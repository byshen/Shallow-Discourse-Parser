already , scientist be develop test base on the newly identify gene that , for the first time , can predict whether a otherwise healthy individual be likely to get cancer
only a decade ago cancer be a black box about which we know nothing at the molecular level
today , we know that the accumulation of several of these altered gene can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state
when function normally , they make protein that hold a cell 's growth in check
the two type of cancer gene work in concert : a oncogene may turn proliferate cell malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene have be damage
a oncogene may turn proliferate cell malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene have be damage
a person who be bear with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy be damage early in life , be especially prone to cancer
he carry a damage gene , have lose a eye to the rare tumor when he be only two month old
it make we New year
equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that control retinal cell growth , make by a Boston doctor name Thaddeus Dryja , have open a field of cancer study , which in recent month have explode
it turn out that study a tragic but uncommon tumor make possible some fundamental insight about the most basic workings of cancer
this basic research will begin show result there soon
Dr. Dryja make he retinoblastoma discovery in 1986
that if people inherit defective version of these gene , they be especially prone to cancer , perhaps explain , finally , why some cancer seem to haunt certain family
he theorize that in the eye cancer , a infant inherit a damage copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
the tumor develop when the second , normal copy also be damage
under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 be miss
he assume the miss piece contain a gene or gene whose loss have a critical role in set off the cancer
the team use a battery of the newly develop `` gene probe , '' snippet of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell
it be the first time anyone have show that the loss of both copy of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
it be extraordinarily satisfy
I be convince that what be true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancer
he be one of two research team in 1984 to report dual chromosome loss for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney call Wilm 's tumor
he believe colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hit '' on cancer suppressor gene , because it often seem to develop in stage
it often be precede by the development of polyp in the bowel , which in some case become increasingly malignant in identifiable stage
gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerge
if both copy of a certain gene be knock out , benign polyp would develop
if both copy of a second gene be then delete , the polyp would progress to malignancy
it be clear that more than one gene have to be damage for colon cancer to develop
it be the confirm evidence we all need that -lcb- gene -rcb- loss be critical to the development of a common tumor
they focus on chromosome 17
for month the Johns Hopkins researcher , use gene probe , experimentally crawl down the length of chromosome 17 , look for the smallest common bit of genetic material lose in all tumor cell
such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene
the deletion Dr. Vogelstein find be in exactly the same spot as p53
researcher in Edinburgh , Scotland , have find that in 23 of 38 breast tumor , one copy of chromosome 17 be mutate at the spot where gene p53 lie
that since breast cancer often strike multiple member of certain family , the gene , when inherit in a damaged form , may predispose woman to the cancer
that about half the cell take from lung cancer tissue they test be miss this gene
Dr. Vogelstein hope soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involve in colon cancer
Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer , a researcher in Great Britain , be close to find another gene involve with some type of colon cancer , think to be on chromosome 5
already two major pharmaceutical company , the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , be collaborate with gene hunter to turn the anticipated cascade of discovery into predictive test and , maybe , new therapy
the idea would be to administer to patient the growth-controlling protein make by healthy version of the damaged gene
it may even be possible to replace defective gene with healthy version , though no one have come close to do that so far
when the company this month announce lower-than-forecast sale of Easy Eggs , the stock drop nearly 19 %
two Minneapolis shareholder suit in the past month have accuse top officer of make `` various untrue statement

the Fleet Street reaction be capture in the Guardian headline , `` departure reveal Thatcher poison
so far as we can see only two person be behave with a dignity recognize the seriousness of the issue : Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulty , who also resign as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher
there be the strict monetarist , who believe that float exchange rate free a economy to stabilize its price level by stabilize the monetary aggregate
there be the supply-side globalist , who seek to spread the advantage of a common currency through fix exchange rate
he not only slash marginal tax rate , initially spark fresh growth in Britain , but he want to regulate monetary policy by target exchange rate , indeed join the European Monetary System
while no doubt agree with Mr. Lawson on everything else , Sir Alan be a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , incline to defend float rate to the death
they increase the after-tax rate of return and make Britain a far more attractive place to invest , produce sudden capital inflow
to push the pound even lower try to cure the trade deficit , a policy Britain have repeatedly prove disastrous
Mr. Lawson , though not allow to join the EMS , choose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark
he reap inflation along with rapid growth , no doubt validate Sir Alan 's prediction in the Prime Minister 's mind

for that matter , perhaps he fix to the wrong currency
we sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher 's reluctance to tie she currency to one govern by the domestic political imperative of West Germany
perhaps the shock would have be less if they would fix to another low-tax , deregulate , supply-side economy
that the retirement of gilt for cash be equivalent to a expansionary open-market operation

better to have a true monetarist policy , just for the experience
they confront stubborn inflation and a sag economy , that be to say , stagflation
this can not be solve by provoke a further downturn
reduce the supply of goods do not solve inflation
we advice be this : immediately return the government surplus to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cut , and find some monetary policy target that balance both supply and demand for money
this be the version of supply-side economics that , in the late 1970 and early '80 , work in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflict Britain today

we would do the strategy and then we would come around and do the budget
this city do not work that way
with a five-year defense plan cost more than $ 1.6 trillion , it be about time we put together a defense strategy that work in Washington
as it be , we identify national goal and the threat to these goal , we shape a strategy to counter these threat , we determine the force need to execute the strategy , before finally forge the budget need to build and maintain the force
these procedure consume million of man-hour of labor and produce ton of paper , and each year , they end product -- the five year defense plan -- promptly melt away
compare the past eight five-year plan with actual appropriation
the Pentagon 's strategist produce budget that simply can not be execute because they assume a defense strategy depend only on goal and threat
by ignore cost , U.S. strategist abdicate they responsibility for hard decision
these people have different agenda
strategist should consider the impact of budget uncertainty at the beginning of the planning process
they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenario would change the defense program
there be no reason that it can not be do for defense planning
step 1 clean up we book
we five-year plan contain three accounting device -- negative money , a above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimate -- which understate the spend the Pentagon have commit itself to by almost $ 100 billion
to make the book balance , as be require by law , somebody invent a new budget line item that simply subtract $ 45 billion
most forecaster , include those in the Congressional Budget Office , assume inflation will be in excess of 4 % in each of those five year
note how the baseline program assume a sharp increase in future appropriation
and it reduce the baseline by $ 106 billion between 1990 and 1994
it freeze the budget at its current level , and force the Pentagon to eat the effect of inflation until 1994
this reduce the baseline by $ 229 billion
it reduce the baseline by $ 169 billion
this can be think of as a pessimistic prediction , perhaps drive by the sequestering effect of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tension with the Soviet Union
they would conclude they effort by produce a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- include the assumption make , a analysis of its deficiency and limitation , the impact on national security , and the best strategy for work around these limitation
these trade-off would evolve priority by reveal when the cost of the b-2 become prohibitive
a strategic review be fundamentally different
it would be run by the joint chief under simple direction : produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be use to achieve U.S. goal
this argument play well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeate the Pentagon and Congress , and unfortunately , there be some truth to it
to say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because act responsibly will provoke Congress into act irresponsibly lead to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its need in the national interest
if we want meaningful priority , we must understand the trade-off they imply before we make commitment

ask about he greatest achievement in public life , he first speak about the quality of he staff
they wonder whether he can be firm with he longtime ally

the thing about the Dinkins candidacy be that it offer hope to a broad range of people
it be a feel-good candidacy

all foreign market be aggressively court U.S. business
the U.S. exchange need both market integrity and cost-efficiency ; long-term growth depend on it
long-term growth depend on it
the most arbitrary of these be the imposition of `` service fee , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign market . other provision have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.These include the extension of liability into area beyond those establish by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages . in addition to increase cost as a result of greater financial exposure for member , these measure could have other , far-reaching repercussion . one section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firm and floor broker liable for damages without willful misconduct.Nowhere in the federal security law be simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstance . it be only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increase litigation.In a already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firm may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of deal with the retail public , deprive the private individual of access to the market . another measure make commodity brokerage firm liable for violation commit by independent floor broker who execute trade for them.This untried concept would expose these firm to potentially astronomical punitive damages . face with the virtually impossible task of supervise the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage firm be likely to stop do business with independent and instead hire they own salaried floor brokers.this would force out of business many of the individual and small firm that function as floor brokers.a consequence of they departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practice would be arbitrarily ban , unless the CFTC be to take specific and timely action to permit they to continue.In other word , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . the affected practice include the placing of oral order , which be the way most public customer order be place , and trading between affiliated broker , even though in some case trade with affiliate may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.also preclude would be dual trading , whereby a broker trade for customer as well as he own account , a practice that provide need liquidity to the market
these include the extension of liability into area beyond those establish by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages
nowhere in the federal security law be simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstance
in a already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firm may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of deal with the retail public , deprive the private individual of access to the market

in 1988 New Era seek a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publish `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' on the ground that Mr. Miller 's quotation from Mr. Hubbard infringe the copyright
the publisher argue in response that the `` fair use '' statute permit quotation `` for purpose such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , ... scholarship , or research
as for the merit , Judge Leval say that Mr. Miller have write `` a serious book of responsible historical criticism
the biographer/critic should not be require simply to express ... conclusion without defend they by example
in such circumstance , free-speech interest outweigh the interest of the copyright owner
he distinguish the two case
in Salinger , Judge Leval note , the quotation be for the purpose of enliven the biography rather than of prove point about the subject
that a few of Mr. Miller 's quotation from Mr. Hubbard 's unpublished writings , because they be not necessary to prove historical point , fail the fair-use test and therefore infringe copyright
in a decision in April of this year , Judge Roger Miner , join by Judge Frank Altimari , agree on deny the injunction and do not doubt that `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' be a serious work but reject Judge Leval 's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright
we conclude , '' the two judge write , `` that lach be the sole bar to the issuance of a injunction . '' have the suit be file in time , they say , `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' would have be suppress
have the suit be file in time Bare-Faced Messiah '' would have be suppress

this case realize that concern
Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear to have a clue
if a author quote `` more than minimal amount '' of unpublished copyright material , as the Salinger decision have it , `` he deserve to be enjoin . '' the court have not define `` minimal amount , '' but publisher , I understand , take it to mean about 50 word
a second decision , hand down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , be another blow against scholarship
the quote could not be find on the tape
while judge have a obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press , `` the right to deliberately alter quotation be not , in my view , a concomitant of a free press

Judge Kozinski find the derivation entirely strain and write that `` for a academic to refer to himself as a intellectual gigolo be ... a devastating admission of professional dishonesty
as Robert Coles write in a review of Ms. Malcolm 's book , Mr. Masson emerge `` as a grandiose egotist ... and , in the end , a self-destructive fool.but it be not Janet Malcolm who call he such : he own word reveal this psychological profile
he own word reveal this psychological profile
we now know that the word be not always he own

Japan do not have a modern government
its government still want to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brake and steer , with 120 million people in the back seat
in a modern system , the government 's role be to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep they well inform so they be capable of make a choice

Japanese put up with it because the government provide job stability and grow paycheck

the other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP , represent the manufacturer ' preference for larger government , control , regulation and protectionism
Lower House election must take place before June

a companion jetty that help hold back the sea look like a rusting junkyard
they figure it be not a very good advert
they be suppose to concentrate on clean out crevice , and not strain they eye look for diamond
for these worker at the bottom of the mine 's pay scale , this be usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal
one man wrap several diamond in the knot of he tie
another poke a hole in the heel of he shoe
a food caterer stash stone in the false bottom of a milk pail

by 1995 it will be plant more often than any other apple tree , accord to a recent survey of six apple-industry sage by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton
the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America 's apple heap
compare to the Red Delicious , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the Fuji be decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less-perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinge of red
to hear most U.S. grower tell it , we would still be in Paradise if the serpent have proffer one to Eve
it have more sugar `` than any apple we have ever test
it have a long shelf life and `` do not fool the public
it do not look nice on the outside while get mealy inside
he be know as the father of the u.s.-grown Granny Smith , a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once say would never catch on
it do , shake the apple establishment to its root
now , even more radical change seem afoot as the grand old maverick of american apple play the role of Hiroshi Appleseed
the Fuji be go to be no. 1 to replace the Red Delicious
New apple tree grow slowly , and the Red Delicious be almost as entrench as mom
its root be patriotic -- with the first tree appear in 1872 in a orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact
for more than 50 year , it have be the apple of we eye
a good Delicious can indeed be delicious
more than twice as many Red Delicious apple be grow as the Golden variety , America 's no. 2 apple
Red Delicious have be overplant , and its price have drop below the cost of production
the scare over Alar , a growth regulator that make apple redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , make consumer shy away from the Delicious , though they be less affected than the McIntosh
the glut and consequent lower price , combine with cancer fear , be a very serious blow to grower
a lot of grower will not be around in a few year
I be go to have to get another job this year just to eat
even if a grower beat they back , he $ 2,000 rent bee might buzz off to the neighbor ' orchard instead of pollinate he
I have rip out a lot of Delicious '' and graft the tree with many different shoot
I have get 70 kind of apple
here be a Waltana
he bite it , scowl and throw it down
it be a real dog
they still buy apple mainly for big , red good look
rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious , maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis
japanese researcher have breed dozen of strain of Fujis to hone its color , taste and shelf life
now the best of they age as gracefully as Grannies , the industry 's gold standard for storability
during the past 15 year , it have go from almost zilch to some 50 % of Japan 's market
that this year Americans will eat about 40 % more fresh apple per capita than the japanese
once somebody eat one , they get hooked
Taiwan already be a big importer of Fujis from other place
I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 year
Washington Red Delicious , by the way , be wholesale for less than $ 10 a box these day

he see a shift in american value -- at least regard apple -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz

on Friday , the firm file a suit against West Virginia in New York state court ask for a declaratory judgment absolve they of liability
from 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficit total $ 1.41 trillion , the government issue $ 394 billion of new direct loan and a additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantee
these figure omit secondary guarantee , deposit insurance , and the activity of Government-Sponsored Enterprises -lrb- a huge concern in its own right , as detail on this page May 3
since the 1950s , federal lending have experience extraordinary growth in credit volume , subsidy rate , and policy application , spur on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmick and deceptive management in particular
as we will see , many of these obligation do not show up as part of the federal deficit
student loan default remain high at about 12 % , and the program have be rock by allegation of fraud and mismanagement
Farmers Home Administration -lrb- FmHA -rrb- loan have turn into de facto giveaway program
loss over the next three year be expect to exceed $ 20 billion
default on Veterans Affairs loan guarantee have quadruple in the past eight year
GAO 's finding be particularly troubling because the FHA have about $ 300 billion in obligation outstanding and have previously be consider one of the most financially secure credit program
the federal government hold $ 222 billion in direct loan outstanding and back a additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantee
secondary guarantee of pool of FHA - and va-backed loan by the agency know as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $ 330 billion
to reduce the risk while still retain the legitimate benefit these program can provide , credit policy must : 1 . use credit to improve the operation of capital market , not to provide subsidy
if the program be mean to provide a subsidy , collect the debt defeat the original goal
Farm lending be enact to correct this problem by provide a reliable flow of lendable fund
the program provide highly subsidized loan to any student whose family earn less than a particular amount
high default rate , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest cost while the student be in school make program cost extremely high
family that do not need the loan can make money simply by put the loan in the bank and pay it back when the student graduate
while the student be in school , interest cost would either be pay by the student or add to the loan balance
guarantee rate be typically 100 % , give lender little reason to screen customer carefully
reduce those rate moderately -lrb- say , to 75 % -rrb- would still provide substantial assistance to borrower
since the government have a dismal record of collect bad debt , the cost to the borrower of default be usually low
simple policy prescription in this case would be to improve debt collection -lrb- take the glove off contract collection agency -rrb- and to deny new credit to defaulter
these provision would be difficult to enforce for a program intend to provide a subsidy , but would be reasonable and effective device for program that attempt to offset market imperfection
loan guarantee do not appear at all until the borrower default , so new guarantee do not raise the deficit , even though they create future liability for the government
by convert a expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resource and reduce the current deficit
predictably , guarantee outstanding have rise by $ 130 billion since 1985 , while direct loan outstanding have fall by $ 30 billion
neither technique be perfect , but both be better than the current system , which misstate the cost of new credit program by amount that vary substantially and average about $ 20 billion annually , accord to the Congressional Budget Office
a budget that reflect the real cost of lending would eliminate incentive to convert spending or lending program to guarantee and would let taxpayer know what Congress be commit they to
many agency roll over they debt , pay off delinquent loan by issue new loan , or convert defaulted loan guarantee into direct loan
in any case , they avoid have to write off the loan
some agency simply keep bad loan on the book
as late as 1987 , the Export-Import Bank hold in its portfolio at face value loan make to Cuba in the 1950
more seriously , FmHA have carry several billion dollar of defaulted loan at face value
until GAO 's recent audit , FHA book have not be subject to a complete external audit in 15 year
establish these practice would permit earlier identification of emerge financial crisis , provide better information for loan sale and budgeting decision , and reduce fraud
the reform describe above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender
without such reform , credit program will continue to be a large-scale , high-risk proposition for taxpayer
Mr. Todt have be vice president and treasurer of Insilco Corp
that such presidential power be necessary to rein in congressional spending

in fiscal 1989 , P&G earn $ 3.56 a share , adjust for the stock split

twenty-five year later , the Voting Rights Act have be transform by the court and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering design to increase the number of black and other minority -- Hispanics , Asians and native Americans -- hold elective office
the program have even be call upon to create `` safe '' white electoral district in municipality where whites be the minority
for the political process to work , all citizen , regardless of race , must feel represent
as be , black constitute 12 % of the population , but fewer than 2 % of elect leader
it be a quick fix for a complex problem
when they reapportion they district after the 1990 census , every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue
in 1972 , the Justice Department require that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and hispanic vote , despite protest that the new electoral boundary would split a neighborhood of hasidic Jews into two different district
sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census become available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district line
the new district line will be draw to maximize the number of solidly minority district
Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38 % of the city 's population and hold only 25 % of the seat on the council
to win they seat on the council , these political leader have have to listen to all the voice in they district and devise public policy that would benefit all
often they have find that the relevant issue be not race , but rather housing , crime prevention or education
insist that they be protect by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites bring a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral district , include four safe white district
the white group argue that whites be not fully and fairly represent , because in city-wide election only black candidate or white candidate who cater to `` black interest '' could win
Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lament the consequence
in the past , people who have to run for office have to moderate they view because they could not afford to offend black or whites , '' he say
now you go to district , you be likely to get candidate whose view be more extreme , white and black , on racial issue
a small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represent by the same spokesman
Madison explain that a representative 's duty be to speak not for the narrow interest of one group but instead for the common good
large , heterogeneous election district would encourage good government because a representative would be compel to serve the interest of all he constituent and be servile to none
as long as we believe that all Americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interest and can live together cooperatively , we political map should reflect we belief
racial gerrymandering -- create separate black and white district -- say that we have discard that belief in we ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people
some highly publicize case involve RICO tro have be the subject of considerable criticism in the press
in order to ensure that the rights of all interested party be protect , the Criminal Division have institute the following requirement to control the use of tro in RICO prosecution
it should be note that these requirement be in addition to any other exist requirement , such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office
the prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedy -lrb- such as bond -rrb- be not likely to preserve the asset for forfeiture in the event of a conviction
the government 's policy be not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime

since the bureau 's estimate for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratio calculate by the Department of Labor , underestimate growth rate artificially depress official productivity statistics
the evidence do not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth have become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I be claim be that the growth trend be understate
the understatement of growth be due largely to the conservative expedient adopt to deal with deficiency in basic economic datum
in a unrelated program in which the Labor Department do estimate output per employee for more than two-third of federal civilian employee , it find a average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980
even if it be assume that productivity rise no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this Labor Department estimate indicate a downward bias in the real GNP estimate of 0.2 percentage point a year , on average
Independent estimate of output in those industry , include one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggest that productivity in finance and service appear to have rise by a average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988
because finance and service contribute 10 % to final business product , miss these productivity improvement depress the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year
that these mismeasurement as detail by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product
in 1985 , a new price index for computer adjust for change in performance characteristic be introduce , and that result in a significantly larger increase in real outlay for durable goods than the earlier estimate have show
for the private domestic business economy , the bias be a bit over 0.5 percentage point

these firm be pioneer in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process

in the come decade a majority of people-oriented company be likely to adopt it
it reduce lawsuit from disgruntle employee and ex-employee , with all that mean for reduce legal cost and better public relation
it help to keep out union
it increase employee commitment to the company , with all that mean for efficiency and quality control
what must you management team do to establish corporate due process

at Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so case because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution
in a large company that mean many hundred of complaint for personnel to handle
see that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it be the `` law '' govern company court and adjudicator
coach they in handle complaint so that they can resolve problem immediately

it will not do any good for anybody unless employee know about it

there be no effective regulation of planner , no accept standard for admission into they rank no way to assess they performance , no way even to know how many of they there be
all anyone need do be hang up a shingle and start plan
alarm , state and federal authority be try to devise way to certify and regulate planner
industry group and reputable planner who be member of they want comprehensive standard , too
they be tire of see practitioner depict collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzee and greedier than a herd of swine
the industry be still pretty much in its Wild West day
the rogue ' gallery of planner involve include some convict felon , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessman who have plan they own previous venture right into bankruptcy , and one man who scam he wife 's grandmother

currently , a registered investment adviser can expect a SEC audit only once every 12 year
a lot of bad thing can happen in 12 year
it do not take a rocket scientist to figure out we problem
such a organization could , among other thing , set minimum standard for competence , ethic and finances and punish those investment adviser who break the rule
Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , say that allow the business to police itself would be `` like put Dracula in charge of the blood bank
Mr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who head one trade group , favor simply assess the industry and give the money to the SEC to hire more staff

the investor range from elderly widow to affluent professional
thus falsely reassure , investor send $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which be divert to unauthorized use
there be some business deal that go bad
Newport Beach operation differ from the Hollywood boiler room in style as well as in dollar
traditionally , boiler room operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customer ever visit they office
when we go there , it be quite different from these Hollywood place where the sandwich be spread out on the table and the people be pick they nose
the case of Matthew Valentine , who be currently serve a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for he role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promise investor return of as much as 625 % on precious metal

people be basically peddle a lot of fear , '' say Arthur Hauptman , a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington
he take issue with projection that do not factor in student ' own contribution
the situation you want to avoid be have somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income
that be crazy
parent should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford
half the amount that the investment table suggest might be a good goal
that way , parent will reduce borrowing and outlay from current income when the time come to pay tuition
he favor either a all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mix both stock and bond
they have lay out about $ 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bond

in appeal to those with a bit of larceny in they heart , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep a investment secret -- insulate himself from be discover and keep he victim from consult with other
that for many investor , the get-rich-quick scam carry a longed-for element of excitement
once people get into it , I be allow they to live a dream
he phone they with update on the investment , such as `` funny thing that happen at the well that week

we have see case where salesman will affect the accent of the region of the country they be call
anything to make a sale
people may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitch when they be in the midst of a major upheaval in they life
sometimes when people be make big change , retire from they job , move to a new area , they lose they bearing
they may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hit they at the right time
almost all of we in comparable circumstance might be victimize in some way
Mr. Cortese , a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer , invest some $ 2,000 in penny stock through a broker who promise quick return
we be save up to buy a house , and my wife be pregnant

the investment be worth about $ 130 today
maybe the next day or even a hour later , I would not have do it
the previous sale be $ 436,000 on Oct. 17
the last time price be that low be November 1985 , when a seat sell for $ 425,000
price peak at $ 1,150,000 in September 1987
at least it have a little dash
most of we have to spend we time on pursuit that afford neither , drab duty rather than pleasure
call it the uninformed trudge after the incomprehensible
besides term life and whole life -lrb- the old standby -rrb- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policy with persistency bonus , policy festoon with exotic rider , live benefit policy , and on and on
what to do
shear of all they rider , special provision , and other bell and whistle , insurance policy can still be group under two broad category : so-called pure insurance , which amass no cash value in the policy and pay off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provide not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be use in various way while the insured be still alive
it be much cheaper than permanent insurance buy at the same age
the policy be write for a specific time period only and must be renew when it expire
if you flunk you may not be able to buy it
even if you be healthy and can renew , you premium will go up sharply because you be that much older
sound great -- or do it
Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money
I would be pay so heavily just to have the option of get my premium back that I would almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
that would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it do not add up to a `` smart money '' move for I
there be no free lunch , there be only marketing
the word `` death '' can not be escape entirely by the industry , but salesman dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemism , prefer to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead
the implication be that you permanent-insurance policy be really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with a add feature
the fact be that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally run a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same thing the insurance company be put you money into
again , no free lunch
investment return on most policy be actually negative for several year , largely because of this
you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invest that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and you cash value and dividend grow over the year
the insure could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loan , '' and none of the proceeds be taxable even though they include gain on investment
it be far more flexible than straight whole life
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount go into investment
I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
these be not certain , either
I call she agent , David Dominici
if interest rate plunge , the insurer may be knock on my door , ask for steeper premium payment to maintain the same amount of protection
these policy rider let I tap a portion of my death benefit while I be still alive
some provision would let I collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stay
other would allow payment for catastrophic illness and condition such as cancer , heart attarck , renal failure and kidney transplant
there be still a load -- annual administrative fee and initial `` setup '' charge -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fee '' for drop the policy early still save I a lot
after one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but id get only $ 14 from the Equitable
at age 65 , when I would stop pay premium , the Ameritas offering would have a project cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assume a fractionally higher interest rate
I be think about use the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first
a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she be do it
through the first six month of 1989 , sale have grow about 12 % from the year-earlier period

Westridge Capital be a index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal be to be nothing more than average
indexing for the most part have involve simply buy and then hold stock in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance
these big investor have flock to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock picker have be able to consistently match the return of the S&P 500 or other bellwether , much less beat it
because index-fund manager be no longer satisfy with merely be average , they have develop `` enhance '' indexing strategy that be intend to outperform the market as much as three percentage point
now the interest be in what else can I do with that money
they can ignore the S&P 500 stock altogether and focus on particular type of stock , such as smaller company , those pay high dividend or company in a particular industry , state or country

the portfolio will be maintain by computer , reduce both fee and , in theory , risk -lrb- because of the large number of stock
people comfortable with the passive approach be use they for other strategy
