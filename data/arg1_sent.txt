BELL INDUSTRIES Inc. increase its quarterly to 10 cent from seven cent a share

solo woodwind player have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because they repertoire and audience appeal be limit
Richard Stoltzman have take a gentler , more audience-friendly approach
and now go on the road with piano , bass , a slide show , and a repertoire that range from light classical to light jazz to light pop , with a few notable exception
but you can not dismiss Mr. Stoltzman 's music or he motive as merely commercial and lightweight
he believe in what he play , and he play superbly
he recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dub `` a musical odyssey , '' be a case in point
clothe in he trademark black velvet suit , the soft-spoken clarinetist announce that he new album , `` inner voice , '' have just be release , that he family be in the front row , and that it be he mother 's birthday , so he be go to play she favorite tune from the record
and so it go through the first half : a ingeniously choose potpourri of piece , none longer than five minute , none that would disturb or challenge a listener
Mr. Stoltzman introduce he colleague : Bill Douglas , pianist/bassoonist/composer and a old buddy from Yale , and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez
a improvisational section be build around piece by Mr. Douglas , begin with `` Golden rain , '' a lilting , laid-back lead in to the uptempo `` Sky , '' which give Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off he fleet finger
Bach 's `` Air '' follow
the end of the first half , however , bring what the standing-room-only crowd seem to be wait for : the pop singer Judy Collins , who appear on `` inner voice
the end of the first half , however , bring what the standing-room-only crowd seem to be wait for : the pop singer Judy Collins , who appear on `` inner voice . '' glamorous and pure-voiced as ever , Ms. Collins sing Joni Mitchell 's `` for Free '' -- about a encounter with a street-corner clarinetist , to which Mr. Stoltzman contribute a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas 's lush setting of a gaelic blessing , `` deep peace . '' `` deep peace '' also feature a slide show of lovely but predictable image of cloud , beach , desert , sunset , etc
it be all too mellow to be believe , but they probably would have get away with it , have they not feel compel to add Ms. Collins 's signature tune , `` amazing grace , '' and ask for audience participation
be this why some of the audience depart before or during the second half?or be it because Ms. Collins have go
Mr. Stoltzman must have worry that he audience might not be able to take it
he also unfortunately illustrate this intricate , jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson 's image , this time of geometric or repeat object , in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that be thoroughly distract from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it
the rest of the concert be more straight jazz and mellow sound write by Charlie Parker , Ornette Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez , with picture for the Douglas piece
be this the future of chamber music
but can audience really enjoy they only if the music be purge of threatening element , serve up in bite-sized morsel and accompany by visual

that be because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , be some distance apart on the corn plant
in a labor-intensive process , the seed company cut off the tassel of each plant , make it male sterile
the first hybrid corn seed produce use this mechanical approach be introduce in the 1930 and they yield as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinate plant
a similar technique be almost impossible to apply to other crop , such as cotton , soybean and rice
the male part , the anther of the plant , and the female , the pistil , of the same plant be within a fraction of a inch or even attach to each other
a similar technique be almost impossible to apply to other crop , such as cotton , soybean and rice.the male part , the anther of the plant , and the female , the pistil , of the same plant be within a fraction of a inch or even attach to each other.the anther in these plant be difficult to clip off
in China , a great number of worker be engage in pull out the male organ of rice plant use tweezers , and one-third of rice produce in that country be grow from hybrid seed
the researcher also pull off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plant in large enough number to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop
the law of heredity dictate that half of the plant spring from these greenhouse-produced seed will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible
in recent year , demand for hybrid seed have spur research at a number of chemical and biotechnology company , include Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co
Plant Genetic 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` complementary rather than competitive
Plant Genetic 's success in create genetically engineer male sterile do not automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrid in all crops.that 's because pollination , while easy in corn because the carrier be wind , be more complex and involve insect as carrier in crop such as cotton

that Ford be in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar share that have move over the past month into the hand of arbitrager wait for the highest takeover bid
its plan for Jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfall investor might reap from a hostile Ford bid
indeed , the government be take a calculated risk
the conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election , expect in late 1991

eventually we come to rest in a soggy patch of field where we have the exquisite pleasure of scramble out of the basket into the mud while the french half of we ballooning tag team scramble in
that include the precision routine of yank the balloon to the ground , punch all the air out of it , roll it up and cram it and the basket into the trailer

you can not say it be a `` tsunami '' -lrb- tidal wave -rrb- , but we be make some headway
interest be a great deal higher than it be a year ago
evidence of the grow japanese demand for mortgage security abound
earlier this year , Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank , have no trouble sell out a special $ 570 million mortgage-securities trust it create for japanese investor
last year , there be only several big investor who be interested
first , they be safe
second , they be liquid
Third , they offer high yield
but there be a risk
issuer of mortgage security retain the right to buy back they bond before maturity
but they do not lose touch with the U.S. issuer

do this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record?does this team have a viable strategy for improve shareholder value , and do this strategy require implementation over a extended period
however , the problem be that once most poison pill be adopt , they survive forever
although the current management team may be outstanding , who will be the CEO in 10 year
the solution to this problem be a time-limited poison pill
the limit could range from three year to seven year
one rare example of a time-limited poison pill be the shareholder rights plan adopt by Pennzoil last year after it receive a huge litigation settlement from Texaco
another interesting example be the poison pill adopt recently by pittsburgh-based National Intergroup Inc. , a diversified hold company

official of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinity , nearly dismiss the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public
since the mid-1980 , Japan 's other major real estate purchase in the U.S. include Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp. 's $ 670 million purchase of a office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc. 's $ 610 million purchase of the Exxon Building , part of Rockefeller Center , in 1986
many japanese company have take the warning by the country 's leader to heart and seek development partnership rather than landmark property
Mitsubishi Estate 's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflect the degree to which company be irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan
Rockefeller may well have find its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government tie and sound resource
in asset term , Mitsubishi Estate be the largest real estate firm in Japan
at the time , Japan have just open its door to the world after about 250 year of isolation and need a western-style business center

Sony be acquire Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transaction value at more than $ 5 billion
Warner Communications Inc. have file a $ 1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producer

one , for example , come from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff
but despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff , official of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly be increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunity

it be still common to read in the press that the church have 10,000 or more full-time American member and 25,000 `` associate
but internal church document clearly show that at its publicity-seeking height , as when it organize a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976 , there actually be only about 2,000 full-time Unification Church member in the U.S
Mr. Moon 's support for a watergate-beleaguered Richard Nixon , the Koreagate scandal , and he prison sentence for income-tax evasion do not help the church 's recruitment effort
defection , burnout , and abduction `` deprogramming '' keep member turnover high
that the membership number have even keep close to its 1976 size be the result of the `` graying '' of the church
the reputed wealth of the Unification Church be another matter of contention
yet these purchase can be mislead
most be obtain with huge input of church money from South Korea and Japan , minimum cash downpayment and sizable mortgage
Mr. Moon 's two english-language U.S. newspaper illustrate the scope of this financial drain
which be a further drain
many american church-owned business , such as a $ 30 million factory to build fishing vessel , be defunct

in recent year , Nissan have institute flex-time work schedule and allow employee to dress casually , even in blue jeans
in recent year , Nissan have institute flex-time work schedule and allow employee to dress casually , even in blue jeans.a rule forbid staffer to own competitor ' car have be lift , and now many designer drive foreign car to get useful idea
and in a japanese corporate first , Nissan recently open the first coed company dormitory for single employee at the suburban Tokyo technical center
this corporate glasnost be a big reason Nissan , after year of make lackluster car and lousy profit , have loosen up its rigid way and now be ride a string of hit , range from the sleek Maxima sedan and porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao , a minicar sell only in Japan
the company 's turnaround be far from complete
the big one : a company 's culture can not be radically change unless top management first admit that thing have go badly awry and then publicly lead the charge
Atsushi Muramatsu , Nissan 's executive vice president for finance , help set the tone in December 1986 , when the company be head toward the first operating loss by a japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery
this be a time of self-criticism to discover what be wrong with we , '' he say
no wonder
Nissan 's market share in Japan have be drop year by year since the beginning of the decade
its U.S. sale sag , partly because of price increase due to the rise yen
at that time , task be assign strictly on the basis of seniority
the oldest designer get to work on the dashboard
the next level down do door
this system produce boring , boxy car that consumer just be not buy
some town-watching excursion be downright comic
other trip be more productive
later , Nissan borrow other Honda practice , include a engineering `` idea contest '' to promote inventiveness
so much so , in fact , that some older employee have resist
despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution have begin to yield exciting car
a year ago , the company completely revamp its near-luxury sedan , the $ 17,699 Maxima , which compete against a broad range of upscale sedan
a year ago , the company completely revamp its near-luxury sedan , the $ 17,699 Maxima , which compete against a broad range of upscale sedan ; it replace its boxy , pug-nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines.since then , Nissan also have launch new version of the $ 13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sport car.the restyle 300ZX cost as much as $ 33,000 and be square off against the Porche 944 , which begin at $ 41,900 . besides new styling , the new Nissans have more powerful engine and more sophisticated suspension system
Nissan help develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicle as its design theme
all these vehicle have sharply improve Nissan 's morale and image -- but have not do much for its market share
that continue through last year
Nissan concede that it will not recoup all its market-share loss in Japan until at least 1995 , and even that timetable might prove optimistic
everyone else be go to catch up '' with Nissan 's innovative design
why
so far , Nissan 's new-model success be mostly specialize vehicle with limited sale potential
that that will start to change this fall , with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan
Nissan instead have keep its new Stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6 %
at $ 11,450 , Stanza price start $ 749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine
even if the new Stanza succeed , Nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment , where its Sentra do not measure up to the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla
Nissan start advertise Infiniti fully eight month before the car hit american showroom
the ad feature fence , rock and pussy-willow bud -- almost anything but the car themselves
on the other hand , Nissan 's sale goal for Infiniti be modest compare with Toyota 's target for Lexus
Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $ 38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedan each month , send about 2,000 of they to the U.S. and keep the rest for sale in Japan
that Nissan be be prudent in follow its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copy Lexus
Infiniti be Nissan 's big business move for the 21st century , and we be in no hurry to generate large profit right away
these day Nissan can afford that strategy , even though profit be not exactly robust
Nissan have record net income of 114.63 billion yen -lrb- $ 868 million -rrb- in the fiscal year end last March 31 , a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two year earlier , when the company lose money on operation
the big reason : for all its cost-cutting , Nissan remain less efficient than Toyota
in its last fiscal year , Nissan 's profit represent just 2.3 % of sale , compare with 4.3 % at Toyota
Nissan be the world 's only auto maker currently build vehicle in all three of the world 's key economic arena -- the U.S. , Japan and Europe
we be in a transitional phase from be a japanese company to become a international company base in Japan
already , personnel official be talk about the need for a `` phase two '' cultural-reform effort of some sort

Mr. Gorbachev badly need a diversion from the serious economic problem and ethnic unrest he face at home
for he part , Mr. Bush have be criticize regularly at home for move too slowly and cautiously in react to Mr. Gorbachev 's reform and the historic move away from communism in Eastern Europe
that the December meeting , which be announce simultaneously in Moscow , will be hold in the unusual setting of ship at sea to hold down the `` fanfare '' and force the two side to limit participation to just small group of adviser
as the two side plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year , they find it useful , I would say even necessary , to hold a interim informal meeting
the president specifically mention U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic
Mr. Gorbachev have for month be publicly urge the U.S. to drop its restriction on soviet trade
that he hope to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S. , possibly at the 1990 summit
in a unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday report that three million soviet have lose they job as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005
do not take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arm control , or the environment
this be vintage George Bush
this be George Bush 's own idea
one other issue the Soviets be likely to want to raise be naval force reduction
that theme have be a recur one for soviet military official for much of this year
one of the reason Bush administration aide be anxious to insist that the come meeting will be informal be to avoid comparison with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former President Reagan 's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik , Iceland
it actually be the argument of leader within the soviet bloc itself that lead the president to seek the December meeting
Mr. Bush decide he want the meeting after talk in Europe in July with the leader of Poland and Hungary , who urge he to support Mr. Gorbachev 's effort to transform the soviet system and to urge he to loosen he grip on Eastern Europe
that its Georgia branch have take on loan commitment top $ 3 billion without the rome-based management 's approval

maybe he do not start it , but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provide a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today
the Mahatma , or `` great souled one , '' instigate several campaign of passive resistance against the british government in India
he policy go beyond he control and result ... in riot and disturbance '' and later a renew campaign of civil disobedience `` result in rioting and a second imprisonment
it be difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizen have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change
where truly representative government be safeguard by constitutional protection of human rights and a independent judiciary to construe those rights , there be no excuse for break the law because some individual or group disagree with it
there may be a few case where the law breaking be well pinpoint and so completely non-invasive of the rights of other that it be difficult to criticize it
the public have a tendency to equate lawful demonstration with non-violent civil disobedience
it be true that both be non-violent , but there be a fundamental difference between they
lawful demonstration , such as peaceful picketing and other assemblage that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of other , be rights guarantee by any truly free system of government
but , before we get on with that , let I make just a few tangential remark about lawful demonstration
they be useful to call public attention to grievance , but they have little value in educate anyone about the issue in dispute
the delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourage overuse of slogan chant through bullhorn , militant gesture , accusatory sign and other emotionally inspired tactic
at best , demonstration be overuse and boringly uninformative
demonstration be particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile
soon the whole purpose of the demonstration be lose in mob mania
it be difficult to justify
some find no harm in the misdemeanor of trespass , minor property destruction , block traffic and the like
these be small price to pay for galvanize action for the all-important cause
assume a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involve a police car
the protester lie down in the street , block traffic , and will not move until the authority carry they away
assume that someone catch in the jam have a heart attack
there be no way to get a ambulance in quickly to move he to a hospital
he die
assume that a tv network be air a celebrity interview program with a live audience
the politician appear be highly controversial and have recently generate a good deal of rancor amid certain group
in a plan protest against he appearance , several member of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the tv camera in such a way that the program can not continue
or maybe the tv network would lose nothing
Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protester
let we look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harm other people indirectly , yet do irreparable damage to the nation as a whole
I be refer to those young man who choose to disobey they country 's call to arm during the Vietnam war and flee to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat
even more at fault be those leader in and out of government who urge and support they defection , thereby give great help and comfort to the enemy propagandist
it be amazing that the ensue mass execution in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on mind so morally fine-tuned
under the guise of `` heal the wound of the nation , '' President Carter pardon thousand of draft evader , thus give dignity to they allegation of the war 's `` immorality
to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these day of intensive media coverage
give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be require
this bring into question the motive of those who lead civil disobedience demonstration
here be a good rule of thumb : if the movement produce the leader , the chance that he be sincere be much greater than if the leader produce the movement
in either case , ask yourself whether you have become better inform on the issue under protest by watch the act of civil disobedience

it be unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturn the arbitrator 's decision , make in a long-simmering `` pay parity '' dispute that predate both the carrier 's chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air

the general public may not know he name , but he be famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circle
now , after beat they , Mr. Achenbaum be join they

at Backer Spielvogel , he will work with client and potential client on marketing strategy
he client contact , meanwhile , could prove a gold mine for a agency that have have few new business win of late

at Backer Spielvogel , Mr. Spielvogel 's hallmark have be personal involvement with all major client
he pamper they
he pamper they ; he invite they to fabulous party
Mr. Achenbaum , too , delve into he client ' business
Mr. Achenbaum 's move follow the announcement last month that he consult partner , Stanley Canter , 66 , would retire
ad agency typically earn a straight 15 % commission
but Mr. Achenbaum pioneer negotiate fee , which often work out to less than 15 %
he ultimately become so well-known for cut compensation , however , that client do not seek he out for anything else
I be very frustrated

in important particulars , the soviet be different from the Chinese
they be already industrialize
they problem be one of inefficiency of a industrial economy

Secretary of State Baker , we read , decide to kill a speech that Robert Gates , deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert , be go to give to a student colloquium , the National Collegiate Security Conference

if Mr. Gates have be allow to say these thing , we would now be hear about `` discord '' and `` disarray '' on foreign policy
in fact , he do
so far as we can see , there be no disagreement among Mr. Baker , Mr. Quayle , the Mr. Gates we have read , or for that matter President Bush

the law that Sen. Thurmond be push would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murder and almost all other killing

when the Supreme Soviet pass law on worker ' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperative a year later , some western observer assume Mikhail Gorbachev have launch the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy
for example , while the law on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state , strict provision be attach on how far this may lead to the development of a free market
before become self-employed , or set up a cooperative , worker must seek permission from the local soviet -lrb- council
permission be far from automatic
private dressmaking , for example , be allow in 10 soviet republic but ban by five
all independent media activity be now illegal , which perhaps be not surprising , but so be the manufacture of perfume , cosmetic , household chemical and sand candle
the first enable the soviet to set price for which goods may be sell
along with some other revealing indicator , these development suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wish to move away from some rigid central control , he be bent on create economic structure of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the austrian or Chicago school of economic thought
Mr. Gorbachev have rule out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods
that would combine the discipline and control of the former with the economic benefit of the latter
the emergence of russian corporatism have be anticipate in journalist George Urban 's introduction to a series of colloquy -- `` can the Soviet System survive reform ? '' -- publish this spring
the fascist concept of corporatism envisage a `` organic '' society in which citizen be spiritually and morally unify , and prepare to sacrifice themselves for the nation
this unification be to be bring about through policy and institution that would unite worker and employer with government in a fully integrate and `` harmonic '' society
the closeness of soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini be evident when Mr. Gorbachev present he economic vision to the soviet Congress
Mr. Gorbachev be in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than be Mussolini
at the same time , he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefit so desperately need
at the same time , the strategy require that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine western-style political pluralism
the most important development in Mr. Gorbachev 's policy for marginalize the opposition movement be the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffer from terrorism
a increase number of reference by the soviet press to opposition group now active in the U.S.S.R. , particularly the Democratic Union , allege that they show `` terroristic tendency '' and claim that they would be prepare to kill in order to achieve they aim
Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see he central task , however , as that of ensure that foundation of a alliance among labor , capital and the state be properly lay before the demand for a multiparty system reach a crescendo
the weakness in he plan do not lie in the political calculation but in its economic prescription
contrary to widespread belief , Mussolini fail to live up to he promise to make the train run on time

overall , pc sale in Japan in the first half of 1989 be 34 % higher than in the year-earlier period
and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more japanese company be conclude that they have no choice
we have too many people in we home office
but it also offer opportunity
Americans be well poise to supply the weapon
after year of talk about sell in Japan , more and more U.S. company be seriously pour in
Apple Computer Inc. have double its staff here over the past year
Apple Computer Inc. have double its staff here over the past year.Lotus Development Corp. have slash the lag between U.S. and Japan product introduction to six month from three year
but the Japanese have to go a long way to catch up
typical be one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy oversee the computer industry
while american pc sale have average roughly 25 % annual growth since 1984 and West European sale a whopping 40 % , japanese sale be flat for most of that time
moreover , japanese office tend to use computer less efficiently than american office do
in the U.S. , pc commonly perform many task and plug into a broad network
but the machine be not on employee ' desk
some machine make chart for presentation
to transfer information from one to the other , employee make printout and enter the datum manually

in the U.S. , one-fifth of the office pc be hook up to some sort of network
computer here be use for datum gathering
but `` basically , there be little analysis do on computer in Japan
but healthy skepticism be only a small reason for Japan 's pc lag
and so `` keyboard allergy , '' especially among older worker , remain a common affliction
japanese `` salaryman '' usually share large , common table and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact
besides , a computer process the japanese language need a huge memory and much processing capability , while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbol
but the complex language be not the only reason
for the past decade , NEC Corp. have own more than half the japanese pc market and rule it with near-monopoly power
but early on , IBM offer its basic design to anybody want to copy it
if a record industry lack a common standard , Sony CD owner could listen to a Sony version of Madonna 's `` like a prayer '' but not one make for a Panasonic player
that be the state of Japan 's computer industry
NEC will not release its code , and every one of the dozen or so maker have its own proprietary operating system
corporate pride as well as the close tie common among japanese manufacturer help explain why
most rival `` have a work relationship with NEC , often through cross-licensing of technology
they hesitate to market nec-compatible machine
the result , accord to many analyst , be higher price and less innovation
while ten of thousand of software package use the IBM standard be available in the U.S. , they say only about 8,000 be write for NEC
because NEC be enjoy a monopoly
there be no price war , no competition
a NEC spokeswoman respond that price be higher in Japan because customer put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S
but the market be change

from a reading of the somewhat scant english-language medical literature on RU-486 , the french abortion pill emerge as one of the creepiest concoction around
abortion via the pill be far more of a ordeal than conventional surgical abortion

in the year since the pill go on the french market , the National Organization for Women and its offshoot , former NOW President Eleanor Smeal 's Fund for a Feminist Majority , have be try to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into get involve
follow the feminist and population-control lead have be a generally bovine press
a June 1988 article in Mother Jones magazine be typical of the general level of media ignorance
for a woman whose period be late , use RU-486 mean no waiting , no walk past picket line at abortion clinic , and no foot up in stirrup for surgery , '' burble health writer Laura Fraser . `` it also mean she will never have to know whether she have actually be pregnant
RU-486 be be administer in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor
she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she be pregnant , but just how pregnant she be
furthermore , because timing be so critical with RU-486 , she will learn , via a pelvic examination and ultrasound , not only that she be pregnant , but just how pregnant she is.No doctor who fear malpractice liability would likely expose a non-pregnant patient to the risk of hemorrhaging
many woman may even see the dead embryo they have expel , a sight the surgical-abortion industry typically spare they
at the behest of pro-choice member of Congress , a four-year reauthorization bill for title x federal family-planning assistance now contain a $ 10 million grant for `` development , evaluation and bring to the marketplace of new improve contraceptive device , drug and method

now he can go further

it be a super-exciting set of discovery
only a decade ago cancer be a black box about which we know nothing at the molecular level
scientist call the new class of gene tumor-suppressor , or simply anti-cancer gene
that oncogene do not cause cancer by themselves
in recent month , researcher have come to believe the two type of cancer gene work in concert
so for cancer to arise , both copy must be impaired
the Dedham , Mass. , couple know even before Bonnie become pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs have a 50 % chance of be at risk for retinoblastoma
that little Will Quinlan have not inherit a damage retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , face no more risk than other child of develop the rare cancer
this test be the first to predict reliably whether a individual could expect to develop cancer
equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that control retinal cell growth , make by a Boston doctor name Thaddeus Dryja , have open a field of cancer study , which in recent month have explode
it turn out that study a tragic but uncommon tumor make possible some fundamental insight about the most basic workings of cancer
to date , scientist have finger two of these cancer-suppressor
the inactivation of tumor-suppressor gene , alone or in combination , appear crucial to the development of such scourge as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix
the story of tumor-suppressor gene go back to the 1970 , when a pediatrician name Alfred G. Knudson Jr. propose that retinoblastoma stem from two separate genetic defect
that in the eye cancer , a infant inherit a damage copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
Dr. Knudson find that some child with the eye cancer have inherit a damage copy of chromosome no. 13 from a parent who have have the disease
under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 be miss
then , a scientific team lead by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah , find the answer
the finding rivet medicine
it be the first time anyone have show that the loss of both copy of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
it be extraordinarily satisfy
but in Baltimore , Dr. Vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School , believe Dr. Knudson be right , and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cell from other cancer
Dr. Vogelstein next turn he attention to colon cancer , the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer
he believe colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hit '' on cancer suppressor gene , because it often seem to develop in stage
they begin uncover a confusing variety of genetic deletion , some exist only in benign polyp , other in malignant cell and many in both polyp and malignant cell
gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerge
if both copy of a certain gene be knock out , benign polyp would develop
if both copy of a second gene be then delete , the polyp would progress to malignancy
they report galvanize other molecular biologist
but Dr. Vogelstein have yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damage , flip a colon cell into full-blown malignancy
they focus on chromosome 17
for month the Johns Hopkins researcher , use gene probe , experimentally crawl down the length of chromosome 17 , look for the smallest common bit of genetic material lose in all tumor cell
that several year earlier a Princeton University researcher , Arnold Levine , have find in experiment with mouse that a gene call p53 could transform normal cell into cancerous one
evidence now be emerge that the p53 suppressor gene be involve in other cancer , too
researcher in Edinburgh , Scotland , have find that in 23 of 38 breast tumor , one copy of chromosome 17 be mutate at the spot where gene p53 lie
the p53 gene have just be implicate in lung cancer
at the same time , the Johns Hopkins team and other be rush to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor gene
Dr. Vogelstein hope soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involve in colon cancer
where these discovery will lead , scientist can only speculate
new cancer drug to slow or reverse tumor growth may be base on the suppressor protein normally produce by the gene
the idea would be to administer to patient the growth-controlling protein make by healthy version of the damaged gene
know as Easy Eggs , the product have disappoint investor
Michael will not confirm the identity of any Easy Egg customer , nor will it say much of anything else

ever since the link to cholesterol be disclose , Americans have begin scarf up psyllium in they breakfast cereal
this seed 's not grow anywhere else in India , or anywhere else in the world
only one thing be certain here : pysllium be likely to remain solely a export item from Sidhpur for a long time
as such , the soluble fiber have a almost fanatic follow in northern India
I can assure you from personal experience , it work
folk doctor also prescribe it for kidney , bladder and urethra problem , duodenal ulcer and hemorrhoid
the transluscent husk of the seed be remove , sift and crush
but some time ago , researcher discover that soluble fiber also lower cholesterol level in the blood
cincinnati-based P&G take a interest
one of the study , do at the University of Minnesota , test 75 people with raise cholesterol level
after 16 week , the group that take three daily teaspoon of Metamucil see a significant dip in they general cholesterol level , and a even larger reduction in level of low-density lipoprotein , the so-called bad cholesterol
in April , the psyllium bandwagon get more crowd
General Mills Inc. , the food giant , launch a breakfast cereal call Benefit , contain psyllium , oat , wheat and beet bran

currently , there be a lull in the psyllium war
but the agency have not yank psyllium off store shelf
it be go to be a sensational thing , '' say Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay
but the news of the boom have yet to trickle down to the farmer
psyllium 's not a good crop
even at the basic chemical , pharmaceutical and cosmetic Export Promotion Council , the government agency that promote the seed , the psyllium boom be distant thunder
without quite grasp the implication of the research on cholesterol
in one way , the psyllium middleman -- the buyer and exporter -- be glad to keep news of the boom to themselves
but there be a catch
this be partly due to the particular demand of the crop
psyllium need sandy soil , dew during the first few week , and then total dryness when its seed be mature
there be other spot on the globe , and in India , where the seed could be grow
in Sidhpur , it be almost time to sow this year 's crop
pass up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel

last year , 45,000 go

we be sorry to see Nigel Lawson 's departure from the british government
the early omen scarcely suggest so wholesome a outcome
british politician divide into two group of chicken , those with they neck cut and those scream the sky be fall
the problem be that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rate , conservative , free-market economist divide into at least three incompatible camp
there be the strict monetarist , who believe that float exchange rate free a economy to stabilize its price level by stabilize the monetary aggregate
in the british case , Mr. Lawson be the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist
he not only slash marginal tax rate , initially spark fresh growth in Britain , but he want to regulate monetary policy by target exchange rate , indeed join the European Monetary System
that Mr. Lawson 's tax cut would have profound effect on Britain 's international account and the value of sterling
at this point , the option be : crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregate , as Sir Alan surely advise , and forget the soar pound
but this devastate the U.S. manufacturing sector , lay the seed of protectionism
Mr. Lawson , though not allow to join the EMS , choose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark
so the british experience present a genuine puzzle that reach far beyond the shore of Albion
we should also add Mr. Lawson 's own explanation , as we understand it
unlike the U.S. , Britain never achieve even a momentary reduction in real wages
unlike the U.S. , Britain never achieve even a momentary reduction in real wages.the wage stickiness , which OECD study confirm be particularly high in Britain , give its economy a structural bias toward inflation
perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cut be after all best absorb by float rate , though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resign over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one
that Mr. Roberts not only chide the Chancellor for be too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also lead the chorus say that Mr. Volcker be too tight when he let the dollar rise
in fix rate the choice of initial parity be crucial , for example , and perhaps he pick the wrong pound-dm rate
for that matter , perhaps he fix to the wrong currency
we sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher 's reluctance to tie she currency to one govern by the domestic political imperative of West Germany
that the unrecognized inflationary culprit be the budget surplus
in particular , `` shadow '' a currency be anything but fix
all the more so when strong voice be hear oppose the policy
what Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remain to be see
they confront stubborn inflation and a sag economy , that be to say , stagflation
this can not be solve by provoke a further downturn
this can not be solve by provoke a further downturn ; reduce the supply of goods do not solve inflation
immediately return the government surplus to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cut , and find some monetary policy target that balance both supply and demand for money

if a tv weatherman get butterfly face the camera again after a questionable forecast , Donald H. Straszheim surely understand
and he be right
in a splashy ad campaign launch in the summer of 1988 , Merrill Lynch urge investor to buy bond
but this September he take a detour if not a u-turn
two well-known colleague who believe Mr. Straszheim be right the first time be David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling , both of whom run they own New York research firm
Mr. Bostian say in August that he macroeconomic index signal recession
Mr. Shilling , who be Merrill Lynch 's chief economist from 1967 to 1971 , have herald a recession for month
that `` it may prove to be the case that we get whipsaw -- that we pull the recession forecast at just the wrong time
however risky the business , it be brisk these day
this be not the quiet economic science practice in the university
Mr. Straszheim meet confrontation that often occur in inverse proportion to the size of the client
no sophisticated professional expect economist to be right all the time
Dennis O'Brien , the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago , adopt a polite approach , wait for a opportunity to ask about the forecast
a good half-hour into breakfast at the Palmer House , Mr. O'Brien look up from he plate after Mr. Straszheim say something about people who believe interest rate be about to nosedive
try to pin down the economist
in a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis , in contrast , the firm 's money manager seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall
it be all in this handout you do not want to look at
that the new outlook , though still weak , do not justify call a recession right now . `` it be all in this handout you do not want to look at.we could still have a recession '' at some point
that the state of the economy be not a simple black or white
another challenge Merrill Lynch 's bond recommendation last year
we be not run that ad campaign any more
it be hard to pin this on one factor
the economy , and especially the employment number , look much better than he expect ; interest rate have generally decline ; inflation have not run amok
Mr. Shilling understand Mr. Straszheim 's problem
there be unbelievable pressure on economist to forecast these number
it be indeed hard to back away from a widely publicize forecast , and Mr. Straszheim be fidget with the handcuffs on this trip
he approach to the recantation be direct but low-key
for some time , we have forecast negative third - and fourth-quarter growth

last week the british display unusual political immaturity
the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Nigel Lawson , resign because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire she trust adviser Sir Alan Walters
the opposition Labor Party leader , Neil Kinnock , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the british lower class , denounce Mrs. Thatcher for have a independent mind and refuse to heed the man in she Cabinet

Mr. Lawson and he european-minded colleague want the british pound formally tie to the west german mark
until he resignation , Mr. Lawson have be conduct british monetary policy as if the pound be tie to the mark
with inflation surge , the pound begin fall against the mark
to keep the exchange rate peg , Mr. Lawson tighten monetary policy and push interest rate up to 15 %
this put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind
the reason be simple
it be fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationship that cause the Chirac government in France to be timid about cut tax rate
the price of attract capital -- whether one 's own or that of foreigner -- be a trade deficit
to avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflate the pound in order to prevent its rise
consequently , Mr. Lawson saddle Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit , renew inflation and high interest rate -- three political failure in a row
it be extraordinary that the British Treasury think it could prevent a trade deficit by inflate the pound
that after the top tax rate be cut to 40 % , the flow abroad of british capital slow , to 50 billion pound -lrb- $ 79 billion at the current rate -rrb- in 1988 from 93 billion pound in 1986
the immense confusion in thought that have be characteristic of western financial circle during the 1980
the most important government have ignore the role of low tax rate in attract real capital investment , instead emphasize financial flow in response to high interest rate
first come monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that be push up by tax-rate reduction.then , when the currency fall , interest rate be raise to attract financial flow in order to stabilize the exchange rate
Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany

the company 's strategy for keep its computer product business profitable -- it recently achieve profitability after several quarter of loss -- call for a narrow focus and a lid on expense

in the opener , Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction value at close to $ 5 billion
shortly after that , Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million and offer its co-chairman , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , the chance to run Columbia
that be where the two script would diverge
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story
he be `` shock '' when Mr. Ross refuse a meeting and make it clear he would stop they
tell they that they do not have a job
Warner deny Mr. Ross ever say any such thing , and , in fact , deny virtually everything Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in they affidavit
tomorrow , Warner will file another batch of document contend that `` the essence of everything these guy be say be basically lie
the matter may never even be try in court
but the bitterness of this battle and the accusation fly on both side make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producer can ever be repair
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do not have much to gain from a protracted battle
but other murkier issue will play a big role
Sony and the Guber-Peters team be hang much of they case on Warner 's willingness last year to release the producer from another contract and on a oral agreement they say allow they to terminate the current write contract if the opportunity to run a major studio come up
just how rancorous the relationship have become be clear from the differ version of the two side ' current business dealings
Mr. Peters say in he affidavit that the movie 's staff be tell last week that Warner be `` take over '' the picture , and another producer would be give all of the order
Hubert de la Bouillaire , a editor on the film , back Mr. Peters in a separate swear declaration
Mr. Peters be `` off the picture
to screen the picture without tell star Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell or Mr. Peters
the less they know , the easier it be for we
that be `` a total 100 % lie

Mr. Semel , in he affidavit , do not mention any hugging or congratulating
he tell Mr. Guber he could not sign any document and that `` the deal , although apparently a good one for he and Mr. Peters , would have a very negative impact on Warner
but Sony be a problem
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters take encouragement from Warner studio executive such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally
the studio still want the producer to come back and fulfill they contract
even White House budget director Richard Darman have trouble find a silver lining in the report
the 1989 deficit would have be nearly $ 10 billion larger have the government be able to spend as much as Congress intend on clean up the thrift industry before the year end on Sept. 30

Sansui be a special case
but analyst say Sansui be a special case.it expect to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year end tomorrow and its liability currently exceed its asset by about 13.8 billion yen
nor do analyst expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchase
that this be not the company 's finest hour
some of Sansui 's fellow audio-specialty company , such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp. , respond to the challenge by quickly bring out mini-component product of they own , by move heavily into the booming compact disk business or by diversify into other consumer-electronics field , include laser disk or portable cassette player
as the yen soar in recent year , Sansui 's deepen financial problem become a vicious circle
Sansui lack the money to build new plant in Southeast Asia
he firm will likely be recommend acquisition of japanese company more often to foreign client in the future
Mr. Nadir brim with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around
such risk take be a everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir , who be 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman
he take Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and use it at as a base to build a conglomerate that have be double its profit annually since 1980

analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $ 115 to $ 125 a share
they value McCaw 's bid at $ 112 to $ 118 a share
McCaw , the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S. , already own about 9.4 % of LIN 's stock
in response to BellSouth 's amend pact , the Kirkland , Wash. , company extend its own offer to buy 22 million LIN share for $ 125 apiece
over the weekend , McCaw continue to call for a auction of LIN
this game be not over yet
McCaw 's bid also have a similar clause
we be very pleased with the new deal
BellSouth 's `` back-end protection be flaw previously
this be a superior deal to McCaw 's
we be surprise
but Kenneth Leon , a telecommunications analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , find the BellSouth proposal still flaw because the company do not have to wait five year to begin buy more LIN share
how many share will be around in 1995 ?
BellSouth 's revise proposal surprise many industry analyst , especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings
for 1988 , BellSouth earn $ 1.7 billion , or $ 3.51 a share , on revenue of $ 13.6 billion
indeed , McCaw seem to hint at that option in a brief statement
they motivation , however , have a strong practical aspect : program trading be hazardous to they paycheck
the portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading be not know , as it be on the New York Stock Exchange , where it amount to more than 13 % in September
other market-maker gripe : program trading also cause the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segment of the stock market
they do so only for customer , however
that be largely because of defensive measure they adopt after the 1987 crash , when individual investor flee the market and trading activity dwindle
market maker become quicker to lower price quote when sell program be in progress
on day when price be tumble , they must be willing to buy share from seller when no one else will
but this skittishness be create liquidity problem in certain OTC stock
it be harder to sell stock when the sell program come in because some market maker do not want to -lcb- take the order -rcb-
they also make money when program trading push the price higher
these big stock greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index
this gap eventually close , but slowly
the main reason for this lag be that individual investor own 65 % of the OTC market 's capitalization , accord to Mr. Hardiman , much more than on the Big Board
the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble 5.39 , or 1.2 % to 452.76 on Friday

First Unilever , the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant , spend $ 2 billion to acquire brand such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden
then Procter & Gamble Co. agree to buy Noxell Corp. for $ 1.3 billion
P&G and Unilever bring with they great experience with mundane product like soap and toilet paper , spark disdain in the glitzy cosmetic trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , spark fear
to blend the methodical marketing strategy they use for more mundane product with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetic company
but some cosmetics-industry executive wonder whether technique hone in package goods will translate to the cosmetic business
Estee Lauder Inc. , Revlon Inc. and other cosmetic house traditionally have consider themselves fashion enterprise whose product development be guide by the creative intuition of they executive
just because upscale cosmetic look like package goods and smell like package goods , it do not mean they be package goods
Unilever and P&G be the habitat of organization man in gray-flannel suit
both company be conservative marketer that rely on extensive market research.P & G , in particular , rarely roll out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing
P&G already have show it can meld some traditional packaged-goods technique with the image-making of the cosmetic trade in the mass-market end of the business
consider oil of Olay , which P&G acquire as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985
the moisturizer , introduce in 1962 , have a dowdy image
P&G set out to reposition the brand by broaden the product line to include facial cleanser and moisturizer for sensitive skin.It also redesign oil of Olay 's packaging , stamp the traditional pink box with gold line to create a more opulent look.moreover , P&G shift its ad campaign from one target older woman to one feature a woman in she mid-30s vow `` not to grow old gracefully
goliath like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantage over smaller rival
next year , Noxell plan to roll out a perfume call Navy
without P&G 's backing , Noxell might not have be able to spend the estimate $ 5 million to $ 7 million need to accomplish that without scrimp on its exist brand
further consolidation in the industry could follow
rumor that Unilever be interested in acquire Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit be widespread
the presence of Unilever and P&G be likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetic
nearly 70 % of cosmetic sale come through mass-distribution outlet such as drug store and supermarket , accord to Andrew Shore , a analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc
that figure have be inch up for several year
the packaged-goods marketer may try fill that gap with a spate of new product
that future product development will be drive more by technological innovation than by fashion whim -- especially among mass-market brand
there will be more emphasis on quality
but success for Unilever and P&G be far from guarantee , as show by the many consumer-product company that have try and fail to master the quirky beauty business
in the 1970 , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods company , include Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquire cosmetic company
only Schering-Plough , which make the mass-market Maybelline , have maintain a meaningful business
Unilever already have experience some disappointment
the ritzy world of department-store cosmetic retailing , where Unilever be concentrate its effort , may prove even more treacherous
in this niche , makeup color change seasonally because they be link to ready-to-wear fashion

the senator respond in kind
Sen. Boren happily tell reporter that there have be `` a meeting of the mind '' with the White House , and that the committee have give Mr. Bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediment impose during the Reagan year
there still be some detail to be nail down
moreover , both side may face political critic
the government face a daunting job of rebuild confidence in its policy
the prime minister and she new chancellor of the exchequer , the untested John Major , need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy move again
it sound like the work of a decade , but the deadline be late 1991 , when Mrs. Thatcher be expect to call another national election
that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable
supporter wonder if she steely , autocratic way be the right formulum today
the prime minister 's insistence on keep a private coterie of adviser -- include a economic guru who openly criticize former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confuse the financial community
the confusion could be costly
currency trader , suspect Mr. Major will not defend the pound strenuously , send the british currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and west german mark
a continue slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate , currently 15 %
that could shove a weak economy into recession
but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they have think
a mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991 while the gruel downturn now expect could stretch into 1992
that would leave Mrs. Thatcher little room for maneuver
for the Tories to win the next election , voter will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand
though Mrs. Thatcher do not need to call a election until June 1992 , she would prefer do so in late 1991
there be a equally press deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic tie to the rest of the European Community
it have send mixed signal about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
since then , the government have leave observer wonder if it ever mean to join
Sir Alan assail the monetary arrangement as `` half-baked '' in a article be publish in a american economics journal
despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan , the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue
of immediate concern be whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson 's policy of track the monetary policy of the west german Bundesbank and respond in kind when the Frankfurt authority move interest rate
as conservative rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hope last week 's debacle will prompt change
we will not have any more of this wayward behavior
it be a unrealistic expectation
she do not want debate in she cabinet
as long as a decade ago , Mrs. Thatcher declare she do not want debate in she cabinet ; she want strong government
she be authoritarian
nonsense
Rand Corp. researcher Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyze a large sample of married woman with at least one child at home between the age of six and 18

in fact , a very high-ranking soviet official tell a american official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy be contemplate
the day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador , the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda , Victor Afnasjev , be replace by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev 's
when Mr. Korotich take it over in 1986 , it sell 250,000 copy
glasnost have make celebrity of man like Mr. Korotich
prevent by the Communist Party from get on its slate of nominee for the new Supreme Soviet , he stand as a independent candidate for Congress from he native Ukraine and win with 84 % of the vote
but as astounding as the change that have already occur be , there be a fragility to glasnost
censorship be not a marxist invention
the czar be no civil libertarian
as late as the 1890s , the russian government prevent any coverage of famine
so glasnost be not a value weave with steel thread into the fabric of russian society
it be a admirable public relation program initiate by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history
what be that point
I would be destroy myself , '' reply Mr. Korotich , who then ask , `` what would that accomplish

Federal Reserve critic use to complain of `` stop and go '' monetary policy
but under Alan Greenspan that have change
indeed , he caution have become legendary within the government
he fuss endlessly over economic statistics , dissect they in dozen of way , probe for hour in search of potential problem
such caution be evident after the recent friday-the-13th stock market plunge
Mr. Greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompt a near-mutiny within the Fed 's rank
and , while the mutinous Fed member have not go public , some Fed governor , most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , be know to have disagree with the chairman 's decision to remain silent
ironically , the anonymous official 's comment have earn some plaudit for Mr. Greenspan
Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend be a `` very important statement
when the central bank take only modest step to aid the market
Bush administration official appear increasingly concern that Mr. Greenspan be cautious to a fault
the administration 's concern be understandable
the economy be show sign of weakness , particularly among manufacturer
export , which play a key role in fuel growth over the last two year , seem to have stall
in addition , the chairman have a wary eye aim a year or two down the road
so far , Mr. Greenspan 's cautious approach to policy have serve both he and the nation well
to begin a unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession
we have get through two stock market crash , and we have go through a election without any major problem
but such caution be no guarantee against mistake

investor willing to look could find double-digit yield at some bank and thrift
but investor look for alternative be not find it easy
there be , however , some alternative that income-oriented investor should consider
a mix of cd and other holding may make the most sense
investor with a heavy tax load should take out they calculator
for a investor pay tax at a 33 % rate , a seemingly puny 6 % yield on a one-year muni be equivalent to a taxable 9 %
some of the more cautious CD holder might like `` pre-refunded '' municipal
but they will have disappointing return or even loss if interest rate rise instead
consider , for instance , two bond fund from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that be both yield 8.6 % on a recent day
you get equity-like return '' from bond if you guess right on rate
these insurance company contract feature some of the same tax benefit and restriction as non-deductible individual retirement account : investment gain be compound without tax consequence until money be withdraw , but a 10 % penalty tax be impose on withdrawal make before age 59 1/2

the number of sudden , unexplained death of diabetic he have see this year be 17 compare with just two in 1985
with proper warning , diabetic can easily raise they blood sugar to safe level by eat sugar or sugary food
we do know there be slight difference in the way human and animal insulin drive down blood sugar
report of Dr. Toseland 's finding in the british press have trigger widespread concern among diabetic there
they have see report of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patient make the shift from animal to human insulin , but do not know if the problem have cause any death
most of the british diabetic who die have be take a human-based insulin make by Novo/Nordisk , a danish manufacturer
that , `` give a ideal world , we would have a nice , neat , orderly process
we would do the strategy and then we would come around and do the budget
this city do not work that way
this will not happen until strategist come down from they ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budget and uncertain future
as it be , we identify national goal and the threat to these goal , we shape a strategy to counter these threat , we determine the force need to execute the strategy , before finally forge the budget need to build and maintain the force
the graph on the left show how this happen
compare the past eight five-year plan with actual appropriation
strategy , however , be about possibility , not hope and dream
that put the real strategic decision in the hand of other : bean counter , budgeteer , and pork-barreler
reform start in the Pentagon
strategist should consider the impact of budget uncertainty at the beginning of the planning process
this kind of contingency analysis be common in war planning and business planning
two step be necessary to translate this idea into action
step 1 clean up we book
that plan exceed the number contain in he budget message by $ 45 billion
the 1990 plan also assume inflation will decline to 1.7 % by 1994
the graph on the right -lrb- which assume a 4 % rate of inflation -rrb- , place these scenario in the context of recent appropriation
scenario 1 , know as the `` constant dollar freeze , '' reimburse the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slope upward at 4 % per year
scenario 3 , the `` current dollar freeze , '' have be the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four year
it freeze the budget at its current level , and force the Pentagon to eat the effect of inflation until 1994
scenario 2 extend the recent compromise between the House and the Senate ; it split the difference between scenario 1 and 3 , by increase the budget at 2 % per year
finally , scenario 4 reduce the budget by 2 % per year for the next five year -- a total reduction of $ 287 billion
the strategic planner in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario , maximize strength and minimize weakness
if , for example , they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber , they would have to sacrifice more and more other program -- such as carrier battlegroup or army division -- as they move toward lower budget level
anyway , ZBB 's procedure be so cumbersome that everyone involve be crush under a burden of marginalia
a strategic review be fundamentally different
it might be fear that even think about lower budget will hurt national security because the door will be open to opportunistic budget cut by a irresponsible Congress
but in the end , it must be reject for logical as well as moral reason
it be the art of the possible in a world where constraint force we to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternative

prediction for limited dollar loss be base largely on the pound 's weak state after Mr. Lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there be dollar retreat
while the pound have attempt to stabilize , currency analyst say it be in critical condition
although the Bank of England 's tight monetary policy have fuel worry that Britain 's slow economy be head for a recession , it be widely believe that Mr. Lawson 's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increase help stem pound selling in recent week
the pound likely will fall in come day and may trade as low as 2.60 mark within the next year
but such a increase could be view by the market as `` too little too late

in early 1988 , when the three-month eurodollar rate be between 7 % and 8 % , the three-month Hibor rate be as low as 1 %
despite the initial support expect , trading in the contract be likely to start slowly
the wound from the 1987 crash have not yet heal , and not all claim against the exchange clearinghouse have be settle
that there may be limit on how much the contract can grow because the Hong Kong dollar be not a widely trade currency

instead of focus on the financial future , Mr. Dinkins have sell himself as a unifier for a city recently touch by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 year of commotion generate by Mayor Koch
the thing about the Dinkins candidacy be that it offer hope to a broad range of people
no doubt , Mr. Dinkins have be a calming influence
more important , he emerge as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst

we know there be pothole for the city out there
if any of we think we be go to sidetrack David 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of he obligation to we , we be make a sad mistake

Ms. Johnson tell they that , if the appliance can not be salvage , they policy cover the replacement cost
Mr. Hammack be eager to know what Aetna will pay for the house , which have to come down
in this case , that be about $ 250,000
that rebuild the house in Los Gatos may cost more than Aetna 's policy will pay

that we have be aim at the wrong target
President Reagan be simply do what he have always do before he election
primarily because there be more to the matter than Ronald Reagan 's personal value , or lack of they
as it be a reflection of the disintegration of public standard

as a last recourse , when all else have fail and you be pin , apologize for have disappoint those who trust you but deny have actually do anything wrong . -lrb- see , for instance , Jim Bakker 's remark upon be sentence to prison this Tuesday for defraud the faithful . -rrb-
consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze 's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concern with the Iran-Contra affair
the soviet foreign minister publicly concede that he government `` violate norm of behavior '' in Afghanistan and just plain lie about the radar station
that be the key to the current `` national disease

Russell Miller 's `` Bare-Faced Messiah : the true Story of L. Ron Hubbard '' be a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.Mr . Hubbard , who die in 1986 , bequeath the copyright on he writings to he church , which license they to New Era Publications , a danish corporation
in 1988 New Era seek a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publish `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' on the ground that Mr. Miller 's quotation from Mr. Hubbard infringe the copyright
District Court Judge Pierre Leval deny the injunction on the ground that New Era have fail to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyer call `` lach
verbatim quotation be justify in order to prove point the author have assert about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity , bigotry , paranoia and other unlovely trait that could not be persuasively demonstrate without use of Mr. Hubbard 's own word
the biographer/critic should not be require simply to express ... conclusion without defend they by example
but Judge Leval feel constrain by a earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbid a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger 's personal letter
he distinguish the two case
still the Salinger decision create a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished material
the case go on appeal to the Second Circuit
but reject Judge Leval 's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright
that lach be the sole bar to the issuance of a injunction
this be too much for James Oakes , the court 's chief judge
that a live person , like Mr. Salinger , have privacy rights that do not apply to a dead man , like Mr. Hubbard
I think that Salinger might by be take in another factual context come back to haunt we
Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirement of historical scholarship
as matter stand , the Salinger ruling , tear from context and broadly construe , be control
the `` Bare-Faced Messiah '' decision strike a blow against the whole historical enterprise
and , as proof of malice , Mr. Masson contend that defamatory quotation ascribe to he by Ms. Malcolm be in fact fabricate
that when a writer use quotation mark in report what someone have say , the reader assume that these be the speaker 's precise word or at least he word purge of `` uh '' and `` you know '' and grammatical error
Ms. Malcolm , for example , write that Mr. Masson describe himself as `` the greatest analyst who ever live
no such statement appear on the tape
Ms. Malcolm have Mr. Masson describe himself as `` a intellectual gigolo
again , no such statement appear on the tape
the majority decision contend that the phrase be a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson 's description of himself as a `` private asset but a public liability '' to Anna Freud and that in any case it be not defamatory
these be only two of a series of fabrication that have , in Judge Kozinski 's word , the cumulative effect of make Mr. Masson `` appear more arrogant , less sensitive , shallower , more self-aggrandizing , and less in touch with reality than he appear from he own statement
who call he such
he own word reveal this psychological profile
there be one sacred rule of journalism
should the green light Judges Alarcon and Hall have give to the fabrication of quotation become standard practice , it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historian -- and for citizen
to invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else have say be to assert the right to lie in print
legal controversy in America have a way of assume a symbolic significance far exceed what be involve in the particular case
it have always be so
the result be a world-famous trial expose profound cultural conflict in american life between the `` smart set and the religious fundamentalist

and so it seem to be with the case of Elizabeth Morgan , the Washington , D.C. , plastic surgeon jail in a child custody case for refuse to reveal the whereabouts of she daughter
it be what lawyer call `` fact intensive
instead , it turn on the dispute and elusive fact of `` who do what to whom
it be difficult , if not impossible , for anyone who have not pore over the thousand of page of court pleading and transcript to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlie merit of the controversy
so we must look elsewhere for a explanation of the unusual power this case have exert over the mind of many , not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world
many of Dr. Morgan 's supporter have take Thurber 's memorable title `` the Male Animal '' quite literally
a second theme be the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case
Dr. Morgan be a highly educate white professional who attend some of the `` best '' school
finally , the case of Dr. Morgan give Congress a opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastime -- bash the District of Columbia government
the local government be discredit in the eye of many resident for a variety of reason
the Morgan case thus tell we much more about the current state of sex , class , race and politics in we society than it do about the fact of Dr. Morgan 's particular situation
the proposal , however , be immediately rebuff by Arby 's parent , DWG Corp
Stevric 's principal , Richard and Steven Buckley , say they lead the acquisition group that acquire the Nathan 's Famous Inc. restaurant chain and subsequently serve as the top officer of the company

but the lack of line become painfully apparent
as the stock market lurch into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13 , Mr. Breeden find himself scurry around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from he desk , where the New York Stock Exchange be on a open line , to he assistant 's office , where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission be connect , to a third room , where a computer monitor market move

more broadly , he want to `` modernize '' regulation by eliminate barrier between commercial and investment banking and by help U.S. financial firm compete in the global market
also unlike Mr. Ruder , Mr. Breeden appear to be in a position to get somewhere with he agenda
for instance , he have not state a clear position on high-risk , high-yield junk bond , a area of grow concern as turmoil in the junk market spill over into stock
Congress seem likely to let the new chairman have he way for a while
these day , Mr. Breeden be win praise in Washington and on Wall Street for he behind-the-scenes role in monitor the friday-the-13th market plunge and the follow Monday 's harrowing morning session
not everyone have jump on the Breeden bandwagon , however
some in Washington contend that it be too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC
I do not think this be a real test
a agency that covet its independence , Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider
that he have adorn he office with five photo of George Bush , one of they feature the First Dog , Millie
but Mr. Breeden already have show a eagerness to run the SEC he way

one day last March , CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank meet for lunch at the Lotos Club here
Mr. Frank tell Mr. Pilson that Olympics official want $ 290 million or more for tv rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway
at that price , CBS be the only player at the table when negotiation with the International Olympic Committee start in Toronto Aug. 23
Mr. Pilson and he team huddle in a hallway and take just 10 minute to return with a $ 300 million offer
Mr. Pound respond , `` it be a deal
Mr. Pilson 's rival at ABC and NBC grimace at the price
with CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $ 2.5 billion for four year of major sport event , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business
while rights fee head skyward , ad rate will not
advertiser already be balk at higher price
the network be pay too much for rights
viewer may not be cheer , either
Mr. Pilson emphasize the ancillary benefit of positive press , contented affiliate station , enthusiastic advertiser and huge audience that might stick around to watch other CBS program when the game be over
that CBS could run up
CBS pursue top sport `` to belie the fact that they be not support affiliate , viewer and advertiser
on just three big deal -- for four year of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $ 1.64 billion
now , Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who say a good negotiator need `` a level offocus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s be face the consequence of he own aggressiveness
next month , talk will begin on two coveted CBS contract , for the pro and college basketball final
CBS be likely to spend whatever it take to keep they
next month , talk will begin on two coveted CBS contract , for the pro and college basketball finals.cbs be likely to spend whatever it take to keep them.The potential bill : more than $ 600 million for several season , a 80 % jump
a few month later , CBS 's college and pro football contract come up for renewal
what happen to those two basketball contract will shape the next five year of network sport
Mr. Pilson be a unlikely big spender
I love Pilson , but he be the guy who complain most bitterly and loudly , '' say Robert Wussler , a former CBS Sports president . `` and yet he company be one reason why rights be so high today
but the 49-year-old Mr. Pilson be hardly a man to ignore the number
a Yale law school graduate , he begin he career in corporate law and then put in year at Metromedia Inc. and the William Morris talent agency
that when he speak out a few year ago , `` I do not say forever , and I do not say every property
and he be not the only big spender
we competitor say we overbid they
Mr. Pilson 's `` major event '' strategy jell after Mr. Tisch take over
then , in May 1988 , Mr. Tisch urgently need to make a bold statement to quell rumor that he might sell the network
Mr. Pilson give he one
he bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France
it be also a fast fix for a ail image
I have be struggle against that for year
that be not surprising
that will please once-grumpy affiliate -- another aim of the Pilson plan
they gleefully await the `` dream season '' in 1990
CBS will air the Super Bowl , baseball playoff , college and pro basketball final and other premier sport event
the CBS plan to use big-time sport as a platform for other series carry no guarantee of success , however
the CBS plan to use big-time sport as a platform for other series carry no guarantee of success , however.no amount of hype will bring viewer back if the show be weak
in this market of 40 channel , sophisticated viewer and the remote control , trial be not a guarantee of anything
during the 1984 Summer Games , for example , ABC tout `` call to Glory , '' but the military drama be miss in action within week
last October , during the 1988 Summer Games , NBC relentlessly pitch a new series , `` Tattingers
moreover , sport be hardly the best way to lure adult woman
nor be CBS a shoo-in to get blockbuster rating
even the boon to affiliate relation may be limit
the sport lineup may add only 1 % to 5 % to a station 's annual profit
it alone be not likely to stop a station from dump CBS show
the World Series , seven night , be not enough of a incentive
and avoid such loss will take a monumental effort
only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year
CBS take to get a unprecedented lock on all playoff game
advertiser be resist higher price
the Winter Games outlook also be mixed
but rival contend that it will take a beating
ABC lose $ 75 million on the 1988 Winter Games , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee
and rating could be hurt by a lack of live event
all prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time difference with Norway , so the result can be announce on the 6 o'clock news
that even if CBS lose , say , $ 10 million , it matter little
ten million be not jack , man , when you get $ 3 billion sit in the bank
moreover , sport have `` claim its place '' as a guarantee ratings-getter
this be not outlandish bidding
this be a situation of very careful businessman make judgment about the worth of product and act on it
that be easy for he to say
and CBS take in the least money in prime time
and the risk go up with each new sport package that CBS lock up
although sport official predict jump of 50 % to 100 % in the major contract come up for renewal , ad rate may rise only 20 %
but the savings will be minuscule
each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $ 2.6 million to $ 2.8 million
Wall Street will not take kindly to that
when Mr. Pilson be ask directly -- can you make money on all this ? -- he do not exactly say yes
yes , they be

yet abortion-rights force remain bitterly critical
the guy have not do one thing about prevention
Mr. Bush be plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question
many Americans still agonize over they own personal feeling about abortion
as it be that he seem to vacillate on it
the political risk would be far less if the president draw a firm line and hew to it
if you have a position , you be better off to stick with it than to move around very much
by he moderate republican heritage as well as the warning of political adviser who say the issue be vital to younger voter , the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments.Yet he be also firmly bind by he hard-line rhetoric and promise he make to anti-abortion activist during he long pursuit of the White House

though import be troublesome , they be not run away with the market , and american company have high hope that steel import quota would be extend for another five year
perhaps most important , Carl Icahn , who have once threaten a hostile takeover bid , be subdue
whose fortune have change abruptly
in addition , USX 's giant steel segment be face soften demand and slip price as well as increase competition from foreign steelmaker and low-cost minimill demand and slip
Mr. Icahn , the company 's deep-pocketed , tenacious adversary , recently disclose that he have raise he USX stake to 13.1 % , and he again threaten a takeover.a battle with Mr. Icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive , to say nothing of one who take the helm less than five month ago in addition , USX 's giant steel segment , represent 34 % of its 1988 sale , be face soften demand and slip price as well as increase competition from foreign steelmaker and low-cost minimills.the import quota get only a 2 1/2 - year extension , and USX be labor under a staggering $ 5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mill and drill for oil
without be push into unwelcome move
in 1986 , Mr. Roderick adroitly dodge Mr. Icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist have build up a 11.4 % stake
and even strike up a unlikely friendship with the interloper
Mr. Corry have hope the detente would continue

will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel company

that Mr. Corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price
in restructure USX
and Mr. Corry do not necessarily disagree
as a capital-drain and labor-intensive business with limited potential
it be not surprising that messrs.roderick and Corry view steel so differently
while Mr. Roderick be rear in the shadow of Pittsburgh 's smoking mill , Mr. Corry grow up in Cincinnati , a city nickname `` Porkapolis '' and more accustomed to pork chop than pig iron
have two major product would lessen the company 's vulnerability to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings
moreover , the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be go , for now
the time have pass for we to spin off steel , '' either in a public offering or to a buyer
however , even USX executive who work closely with he be not sure about he long-term goal
he have a clear sense of where he want the company to go

you Oct. 2 editorial `` reding , wrighting & erithmatic '' on the recent `` education summit '' be like most piece on the subject of education
oddly , though , on the very same page you print a comment that address one of the most serious shortcoming of the american education system
japanese child be raise in a way many Americans would find severe
that american child , on the whole , be among the most undisciplined in the world , make any attempt at improvement in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful

Japan have climb up from the ash of World War II and a gross national product of about $ 800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialize nation
until 1980 it be a model develop nation
the government build port , bridge , highway , school , hospital and railway
the government build port , bridge , highway , school , hospital and railways.when industry be weak , it protect they
that system have work
the standard of living have increase steadily over the past 40 year
the people have give they lead and only credible political party , the Liberal Democratic Party , clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 year
the symptom all point to one thing
Japan do not have a modern government
its government still want to sit in the driver 's seat , set the speed , step on the gas , apply the brake and steer , with 120 million people in the back seat
the japanese government do not allow this
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually be a ministry for farmer and fisherman instead of a ministry of provision
the Ministry of Health and Welfare be a ministry of doctor and pharmaceutical company rather than a organization dedicate to protect the health of the people
the Ministry of Education be nothing but a cartel for licensed teacher , and certainly do not act on behalf of student
the Ministry of Construction spread concrete throughout the country and boast in international conference that Japan 's paved roadway per capita be the longest in the world , but they seldom think of the poor commuter who spend so much time sit in traffic
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs work for itself , support japanese diplomat who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that they seat at the dinner table be next to the host 's
all this illustrate that japanese ministry still have a `` provider '' mentality
they do not serve the people , and particularly not consumer
the rest of the world accept such method when Japan be develop
Japan be not a political country
it be a bureaucratic country
the Diet play a minor role compare with the powerful bureaucratic system
most bill be draft by bureaucrat , not politician
so most bill be pass without full discussion
a recent example be the 3 % consumption tax on all commercial activity
this make enormous sense in Japan , where direct tax account for more than 70 % of revenue and the capture rate of direct tax be so unfair
if you be a salaried man , amen ! 100 % capture
if you be a salaried man , amen ! 100 % captured.if you be a retailer , 50 % , and a farmer , 30 %

against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP have be paralyze
now be the time to reform the government from a provider , developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern , industrialized nation in which consumer have the ultimate choice
if the LDP , as currently compose , can not make the transformation , then it should split into two party
one party could stand for consumer interest , small government , free trade and globalism to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open country
the LDP must make a decision immediately
Lower House election must take place before June
we must not forget , however , that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shock in real-estate and financial market
early this century , diamond mining in the magnificent dune where the Namib Desert meet the Atlantic Ocean be a day at the beach

a japanese apple call the Fuji be crop up in orchard the way Hondas do on U.S. road
by 1995 it will be plant more often than any other apple tree , accord to a recent survey of six apple-industry sage by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton
it certainly will not get there on look
compare to the Red Delicious , the exemplar of apple pulchritude , the Fuji be decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller , less-perfectly shaped , greenish , with tinge of red
but how sweet it be
it have more sugar `` than any apple we have ever test
and `` do not fool the public
Mr. Auvil , razor sharp at 83 , have pick and pack a zillion peck of apple over the past 65 year
that the conventional wisdom once say would never catch on
it do , shake the apple establishment to its root
now , even more radical change seem afoot as the grand old maverick of american apple play the role of Hiroshi Appleseed
the Delicious hegemony will not end anytime soon
and the Red Delicious be almost as entrench as mom
its root be patriotic -- with the first tree appear in 1872 in a orchard near Peru , Iowa , to be exact
for more than 50 year , it have be the apple of we eye
a good Delicious can indeed be delicious
but the apple industry be ripe for change
Red Delicious have be overplant , and its price have drop below the cost of production
the scare over Alar , a growth regulator that make apple redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic , make consumer shy away from the Delicious
the glut and consequent lower price , combine with cancer fear , be a very serious blow to grower
but I be go to lose $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 on it
some 500 insect and 150 disease wiggle , chew and romp through grower ' nightmare , include maggot , mite , mildew , thrips , black rot and the flat-headed borer
though grower can not always keep the worm from the apple , they can protect themselves against the price vagary of any one variety by diversify
I have rip out a lot of Delicious '' and graft the tree with many different shoot
I have get 70 kind of apple
here be a Waltana , '' he exclaim , pick one off a tree
scowl and throw it down
supermarket be get into the variety act , too
and store be expand shelf space for unconventional , but tastier , and often pricier , apple
the Fuji be a product of meticulous japanese pomological engineering
japanese researcher have breed dozen of strain of Fujis to hone its color , taste and shelf life
in the cornucopia of go-go apple , the Fuji 's track record stand out
the japanese apple market be very key to high quality and so apple be more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity
but in California there be a Fuji apple cult
that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyer at $ 40 a box if he have they
but he first crop will not be pick till next year
I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 year
Fujis , in part , as strike a blow against the perversion of U.S. apple by supermarket
when the chain store take over , there be no longer a connection between grower and consumer
then , as grower breed they more for look , and to satisfy supermarket chain ' demand of long-term storage , the Red go into decline
the Fuji , to be sure , have blemish too
moreover , the frumpy Fuji must compete with a increasingly dolledup Delicious
still , Mr. Auvil point out , Grannies become popular without big , red look , so why not Fujis
a shift in american value -- at least regard apple -- toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz
the firm have all say that West Virginia 's suit be without merit
few people be aware that the federal government lend almost as much money as it borrow
from 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficit total $ 1.41 trillion , the government issue $ 394 billion of new direct loan and a additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantee
Federal credit program date back to the New Deal , and be mean to break even financially
and budget gimmick and deceptive management in particular
but recent event indicate that federal credit be out of control
student loan default remain high at about 12 % , and the program have be rock by allegation of fraud and mismanagement
Farmers Home Administration -lrb- FmHA -rrb- loan have turn into de facto giveaway program
student loan default remain high at about 12 % , and the program have be rock by allegation of fraud and mismanagement.Farmers Home Administration -lrb- FmHA -rrb- loan have turn into de facto giveaway program ; loss over the next three year be expect to exceed $ 20 billion
last month , the General Accounting Office report that default in Federal Housing Administration guarantee be five time as high as previously estimate , and that FHA 's equity fall to minus $ 2.9 billion
if the program continue they present path , the potential government loss be stagger
the federal government hold $ 222 billion in direct loan outstanding and back a additional $ 550 billion in primary guarantee
although external event have contribute to the morass , the principal cause of the current crisis be internal and generic to all program
there be a fundamental conflict between provide a subsidy and maintain the integrity of a credit program
for example , legal restriction on interstate banking once inhibit the supply of credit to the agricultural sector
for example , student loan currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problem create by the fact that student ' future earnings be not accept as collateral
the program provide highly subsidized loan to any student whose family earn less than a particular amount
high default rate , a low interest rate , and government coverage of all interest cost while the student be in school make program cost extremely high
in contrast , a student loan program that be mean solely to correct capital-market imperfection would allow loan for any student , regardless of family income , at market or near-market rate
give the structure of most credit program , it be surprising that default rate be not even higher
guarantee rate be typically 100 % , give lender little reason to screen customer carefully
borrower ' incentive be equally skewed
since the government have a dismal record of collect bad debt , the cost to the borrower of default be usually low.in addition , it be often possible to obtain a new government loan even if exist debt be not pay off
simple policy prescription in this case would be to improve debt collection -lrb- take the glove off contract collection agency -rrb- and to deny new credit to defaulter
since the budget measure cash flow , a new $ 1 direct loan be treat as a $ 1 expenditure , even though at least part of the loan will be pay back
loan guarantee do not appear at all until the borrower default , so new guarantee do not raise the deficit , even though they create future liability for the government
by convert a expenditure or loan to a guarantee , the government can ensure the same flow of resource and reduce the current deficit
this figure could be estimate use technique employ by private lender to forecast loss , or determine by sell loan to private owner -lrb- without federal guarantee -rrb-
but both be better than the current system
creative accounting be a hallmark of federal credit
many agency roll over they debt , pay off delinquent loan by issue new loan , or convert defaulted loan guarantee into direct loan
many agency roll over they debt , pay off delinquent loan by issue new loan , or convert defaulted loan guarantee into direct loans.In any case , they avoid have to write off the loan
some agency simply keep bad loan on the book
many agency roll over they debt , pay off delinquent loan by issue new loan , or convert defaulted loan guarantee into direct loans.In any case , they avoid have to write off the loans.some agency simply keep bad loan on the book ; as late as 1987 , the Export-Import Bank hold in its portfolio at face value loan make to Cuba in the 1950
more seriously , FmHA have carry several billion dollar of defaulted loan at face value
the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practice , include the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audit
Government lending be not intend to be a way to obfuscate spending figure , hide fraudulent activity , or provide large subsidy
the reform describe above would provide a more limited , but clearer , safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender

the Voting Rights Act of 1965 be enact to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern black to go to the poll , unhindered by literacy test and other exclusionary device
in the 1980s , the Justice Department and lower federal court that enforce the Voting Rights Act have require state legislature and municipal government to create the maximum number of `` safe '' minority election district
the new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minority in political office -- be laudable
one essential indicator that they be be that member of minority group get elect to public office with reasonable frequency
but racial gerrymandering be not the best way to accomplish that essential goal
example of the divisive effect of racial gerrymandering can be see in two city -- New York and Birmingham , Ala
when Congress first amend the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern state
this year , a commission appoint by the mayor to revise New York 's system of government complete a new charter , expand the City Council to 51 from 35 member
sometime in 1991 , as soon as the 1990 census become available , a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district line
the new district line will be draw to maximize the number of solidly minority district
several member of New York 's sit City Council represent heterogeneous district that bring together sizable black , hispanic , and non-hispanic white population
to win they seat on the council , these political leader have have to listen to all the voice in they district and devise public policy that would benefit all
in Birmingham , which be 57 % black , whites be the minority
insist that they be protect by the Voting Rights Act , a group of whites bring a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral district , include four safe white district
but in June the Justice Department approve a districting plan for Birmingham that carve out three white-majority district and six black-majority district
Richard Arrington , Birmingham 's black mayor , lament the consequence
in the past , people who have to run for office have to moderate they view because they could not afford to offend black or whites
that the electoral district for Congress be too large and encompass too many different economic interest
but James Madison refute that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatise ever write , no. 10 of the Federalist Papers
that a representative 's duty be to speak not for the narrow interest of one group but instead for the common good
Madison 's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide we
as long as we believe that all Americans , of every race and ethnic background , have common interest and can live together cooperatively , we political map should reflect we belief

as part of the approval process for RICO prosecution , the prosecutor must submit any propose forfeiture tro for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section

Mr. DaPuzzo also complain that the sharp swing in stock price lately be scare away retail and foreign investor
the volatility inherent in program trading trouble other trader , too
they do not like the risk they be force to assume when price swing so drastically
that mean that on day when price be tumble and seller abound they must be willing to buy share from seller when no one else will
but the recent volatility in stock price cause by the program trading have make some market maker less willing to soak up the stock that be for sale
the situation make it harder to buy and sell share quickly , exacerbate the rise and fall in stock price during program-dominated trading

we be happy , we guess , to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets , five year after we start write about it
without question , something intriguing be go on in the policy chamber of the Politburo
it be not enough
if the Soviets want to be believe , they need to start tell the truth about more than the totally obvious
the U.S. government have never waiver in its assessment of this incident as a accident at a biological weapon facility there
since Mr. Shevardnadze do not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet , the Soviet Union 's official position remain that the anthrax death be cause by tainted meat
and we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of he emissary yet deserve to have the West take they word for it
the U.S. government 's Sverdlovsk complaint , as with Krasnoyarsk , be no mere political posturing
the Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow they to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violate the 1972 agreement or , alternatively , that would give U.S. specialist reasonable confidence that this be a wholly civilian accident

corporate manager who want to start they own business be the highest failure risk
they know all the answer
the blue-collar worker who decide to start a business will listen and take advice
that they gather a small group of adviser around they , listen to what they have to say , prepare a business plan and they be on they way
successful american business owner do the same thing
avoid failure be easy
I think it be more a issue of style
I would view it as a net positive
the company can go about its business
that neither Mr. Fireman nor Mr. LaBonte would be available for comment
for example , toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well , a new food and health magazine due out next summer
this be a impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry
and despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figure release at the meeting here indicate thing may be turn around
for the first nine month , advertising page in consumer magazine track by the Publishers Information Bureau increase 4 % from the same period last year , to 125,849 page
total magazine ad revenue for the same period increase 12 % to $ 4.6 billion
though some magazine be thrive , the magazine publish industry remain a risky business

Mr. Lipstein 's absence from the meeting here raise speculation that the sale be in trouble
that the sale be proceed as plan
the magazine be strong
magazine can no longer be consider institution
Publishers will find that some magazine have serve they purpose and should die
there be also indication that the number of magazine entrepreneur , traditionally depend upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-up , be dwindle
some entrepreneur be still active , though

Donald Vinson , who oversee the experiment , be not some white-coated researcher
little know outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employ more than 100 psychologist , sociologist , marketer , graphic artist and technician
recently , Litigation Sciences help Pennzoil Co. win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against Texaco Inc
largely as a result , Litigation Sciences have more than double in size in the past two year
meanwhile , competitor be be spawn almost daily ; some 300 new business -- many just one-person shop -- have spring up
the industry 's total revenue approach $ 200 million
despite they ubiquity , the consultant be not entirely welcome
and memorialize on the movie screen
in the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberation unmask each juror 's bias and purge it from play a role in the verdict
after hour of conflict and debate , that jury focus on the fact with near-perfect objectivity
litigation consulting be highly manipulative
but the effort be also be make to try and cause juror not to decide thing rationally
that consultant can be very effective
that the consultant ' grow influence exacerbate the advantage of litigant wealthy enough to afford such pricey service
sophisticated trial consulting grow , ironically , from the radical political movement of the 1960 and 1970 before find its more lucrative calling in big commercial case
in that case , a group of left-leaning sociologist interview 252 register voter around Harrisburg
the defense also learn that college-educated people be uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War

the fledgling science go corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hire a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case
the problem for IBM trial lawyer Thomas Barr and David Boies be how to make such a highly technical case understandable

Mr. Vinson , the professor , get the law bug and form Litigation Sciences
the hardest thing in any complex case be to retain objectivity and , in some sense , you ignorance
when you give a opening argument to you wife or a friend and get some response to it
Energy Transportation retain Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollar , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow
just before the actual closing argument , the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow juror , each of whom be be pay $ 150 a day
the juror , who do not know which side have retain they , decide for Energy Transportation , and award $ 500 million in damages
it be just like weather forecasting
forecasting be only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work
if it be a case in which the client seek punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people be far more likely to grant they
so would someone recently divorce or widow
for personal-injury case , Litigation Sciences seek defense juror who believe that most people , include victim , get what they deserve
Litigation Sciences do not make moral distinction
if a client need prejudiced juror , the firm will help find they
we do not control the fact
but any lawyer will select the fact and the strategy to employ
once a jury be select , the consultant often continue to determine what the juror ' attitude be likely to be and help shape the lawyer ' presentation accordingly
logic play a minimal role here
in one personal-injury case , a woman claim she have be injure when she slip in a pool , but the fall do not explain why one of she arm be discolor bluish
by repeatedly draw the jury 's attention to the arm , the defense lawyer plant doubt about the origin of the woman 's injury
the ploy work
in a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultant concentrate on encourage the jury to shift the blame
slick graphic , pre-test for effectiveness , also play a major role in Litigation Sciences ' operation
that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually
computer-generated video help
the average american watch seven hour of tv a day
lawyer remain divide about whether anything be wrong with all this
but they insist that the best trial lawyer have always employ similar tactic
they may not have be able to articulate it all , but they do it
many lawyer maintain that all be fair in the adversary system as long as no one tamper with the evidence
litigation consulting be not a guarantee of a favorable outcome
Litigation Sciences concede that in one in 20 case it be flatout wrong in its prediction
some litigator scoff at the notion that a sociologist know more than they do about what make a jury tick
for more than a decade , Mr. Etzioni , the sociologist , have be a lead critic of the masseur
but the last thing you want to do be manipulate the subconscious to make they think better
in most civil case , judge allow each side three such challenge
Mr. Etzioni also suggest forbid anyone from gather background information about the juror
even some lawyer who have use consultant to they advantage see a need to limit they impact
Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's service , caution against court ' allow extensive jury question -lrb- know as voir dire -rrb- or give out personal information about the juror

Silicon Graphics also plan to unveil even less expensive machine in the near future
Silicon Graphics ' strategy seem to be pay off
revenue for its first quarter end Sept. 30 be $ 86.4 million , a 95 % increase over the year-ago period
they , or at least something less efficient than today 's thin-walled unit , may soon be make a comeback
these and other expensive change in product range from auto air conditioner to foam cushioning to commercial solvent be in prospect because of something call the Montreal Protocol , sign by 24 nation in 1987
in one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory effort to date -- involve product with a annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatory agree to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbon -lrb- cfc
the U.S. Senate like the treaty so well it ratify it by a vote of 89 to 0
that be a lot of banishment , as it turn out
cfc be the primary ingredient in a gas , often refer to by the Du Pont trade name freon , which be compress to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment
gas contain cfc be pump into polyurethane to make the foam use in pillow , upholstery and insulation
but even though by some estimate it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolant , foam agent and solvent and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitute , the Montreal Protocol 's legion of supporter say it be worth it
I would be the first to admit that there be not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problem
but the nature of the problem be such that many other feel it have to be address soon , before all the evidence be in
but do it have to be so soon
that even if cfc be release into the atmosphere at a accelerate rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century
and the importance of human-generated cfc in reduce it be largely a matter of conjecture
the ozone layer be constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure
another argument of the environmentalist be that if substitute be available , why not use they
as it happen , Arthur D. Little be not at all interested in throw cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theory
it be interested in make some money advise industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs
maybe we should ask why it be that Du Pont so quickly capitulate and issue a statement , give it wide publicity , that it be withdraw CFCs
and be try instead to cash in on they , although they never care to put it quite that way
Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also have one , and be build a plant in Louisiana to produce it
there be still other who do not mind see new crisis arise
environmental group would soon go out of business be they not able to send out mailing describe the latest threat and ask for money to fight it
University professor and consultant with scientific credentials see a huge market for they service evaporate when price decontrol destroy the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy
in other word , environmentalism have create a whole set of vested interest that fare better when there be many problem than when there be few
that tend to tilt the public debate toward `` solution '' even when some of the most knowledgeable scientist be skeptical about the seriousness of the threat and the insistence of urgency
with most legislature adjourn for the year , small business be tally its scorecard

by move 21 , D.T. have fall into a deep positional trap.it allow Mr. Kasparov to exchange he dark-squared bishop for one of D.T. 's knight
consistently , D.T. be over-optimistic about its chance
he also launch a kingside storm , sacrifice a pawn to denude D.T. 's king
no amount of weasle could have save this game for D.T
in a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problem
after only 11 move for each side , the computer 's position be shaky
and when a defensive move be call for , D.T. pass up a obvious pawn move and instead expose its queen to immediate tactical threat

27 area contain a third of Poland 's population be regard as `` ecological hazard '' due to multiple violation of standards.norms be consistently exceed at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitor site and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions.four-fifth of Poland 's soil have become highly acidify ; 70 % of its southern forest be project to die by century 's end

conference participant see these effect as flow directly from -lrb- a -rrb- marxist devaluation of environmental resource , which be not produce by labor ; -lrb- b -rrb- plan economy ' inability to control pollution where enterprise be state-owned and penalty be pay by the government ; and -lrb- c -rrb- the continue stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , produce a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resource than in the West
indeed , skepticism be amply capture by a joke tell by Poles at the conference : `` the world must be come to a end
the Russians be talk peace
but the implication of such a shift to market approach go well beyond the fact that Poland be already work on nationwide emission trade to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permit in some republic next year
face with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocket inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidy to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance

higher earnings help some issue
why can not we teach we child to read , write and reckon
it be not that we do not know how to , because we do
and the reason we do not want to be that effective education would require we to relinquish some cherish metaphysical belief about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherish vested interest
but what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity
no one can say
the whole notion of `` creativity '' in education be -lrb- and be -rrb- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against discipline instruction , which be -lrb- and be -rrb- regard as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talent and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentiality inherent in the soul of all we child
fortunately , these same parent do want they child to get a decent education as traditionally understand , and they have enough common sense to know what that demand
the reason be complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimate
it also provide teacher with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have pass course in educational psychology and educational philosophy
I myself take such course in college , think I might end up a schoolteacher
but it be unfair to dump on teacher , as distinct from the educational establishment
and , on the whole , they be seriously commit to conscientious teaching
but they need not be to do they job well
but we education proceed at the hand of those other , who be merely competent and conscientious
in this sense , a teacher can be compare to one 's family doctor
if he be brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
we teacher be not a important factor in we educational crisis
whether they be or be not underpaid be a problem of equity ; it be not a educational problem
they would educate we child better if only they get a few thousand dollar a year more
but there be not one shred of evidence that , other thing be equal , salary differential result in educational differential
if we wish to be serious about american education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do
conversely , there be the majority of unsuccessful school , and we know which effort at educational reform be doom beforehand
in this respect , it would be helpful if we political leader be mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned
thus at the recent governor ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announce that `` this country need a comprehensive child-development policy for child under five
a comprehensive development policy for governor over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need
what Gov. Clinton be advocate , in effect , be extend the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten year
whether desirable or not , this be a child-care program , not a educational program
parental involvement '' be a bad idea
parent be too likely to blame school for the educational limitation of they child
parent should be involve with they child 's education at home , not in school
they should see to it that they kid do not play truant ; they should make certain that the child spend enough time do homework ; they should scrutinize the report card
here , the experience of New York City be decisive
locally elect school board , especially in we larger city , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politician or would-be politician
decade of educational research tell we unequivocally that even smaller class have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupil
the new money flow into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busy itself pile more and more paper work on the teacher
there be neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditure -lrb- in real term -rrb- have increase sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century educational performance have decline
student should move up the educational ladder as they academic potential allow
the notion that tracking be somehow `` undemocratic '' be absurd
to realize they full academic potential
it be generally desirable to use older textbook -- many of they , alas , out of print -- rather than newer one
the latter be modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial
they be base on dubious psychological and sociological theory rather than on educational experience
most important of all , school should have principal with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matter of student discipline
study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tell we that the best school be those that be free of outside interference and be govern by a powerful head
study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tell we that the best school be those that be free of outside interference and be govern by a powerful head.with that authority , of course , go a unambiguous accountability
that in the past IBM have develop broad software strategy only for problem that cross industry line

the estimate of real gross national product prepare by the Bureau of Economic analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth
evidence suggest defect in the official output estimate
this bias be in no way deliberate
this mean that no allowance be make for possible increase in output per unit of labor
in a unrelated program in which the Labor Department do estimate output per employee for more than two-third of federal civilian employee , it find a average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980
the federal productivity estimator use labor input , rather than output , datum for they calculation of half of private financial and service industry as well
that productivity in finance and service appear to have rise by a average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988
the second source of error in growth statistics be the use of inappropriate deflator to adjust for price change
finally , the official estimate understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvement in quality of goods and service
in sum , the bias ennumerate above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP

up to now , Drexel have make a rapid-fire series of settlement with 25 state and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico
the firm be meet resistance from some big state , include New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri
official in some of these state say they do not want to simply accept the settlement offer by Drexel
it do not expect any of its state brokerage licens will be revoke , and even if some be , its security business would not be directly hurt
I do not have any argument with those who come to different conclusion
I do not think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be lose any licens
more than $ 2.8 million have be pay to 26 state and that Drexel still expect to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million
that total would be important for Drexel
the investment bank have previously announce that as part of its punishment it would create a independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the security industry
New Jersey , for example , be ask to accept $ 300,000 , but refuse
Connecticut already have issue a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license
this particular issue go to the very integrity of the capital-formation market
particularly touchy be the case of New York , which be Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that lead to the firm 's legal difficulty
this process should point out that it be not go to be easy for a firm that be convict of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business
Time Warner emphasize in a news release that it should be evaluate base on its cash flow , which the company define as earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization
some analyst at least be buy that argument , and be not alarm by the loss
for example , Warner make more than $ 100 million from film entertainment in three month
in the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own report net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share
on a pro forma basis , include all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner have a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compare with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier
for the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compare with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cent a share
Time Warner 's operating earnings get a boost from Warner 's record box-office result

Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , be be shake to its very foundation
at the same time , Lloyd 's be besiege by disgruntled investor and hamstring by inefficient but time-honored way of conduct business
Lloyd 's be on the rope
it need more discipline
most troublesome be the shrink pool of `` name , '' the well-heeled investor -lrb- some of they royal -rrb- who , as member of about 360 syndicate , underwrite policy
some 1,750 member quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignation in 1987
lackluster return be one reason
the average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which result be available , be 6.5 % , accord to Chatset Ltd. , a insurance consulting firm in London
many of the 31,329 investor who remain be begin to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenet , the concept of unlimited personal liability
during the five-year period end 1986 , roughly 80 % of the name have money tie up in money-losing syndicate , accord to Chatset consultant
the peril of unlimited liability loom large for a number of they now
which have be hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claim
Ms. Atkins now face potential loss of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000
unease be widespread among exchange member
I can not think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now
the downside be very considerable , and at the moment the upside be very marginal
meanwhile , competition from rival unencumbered by history be intensify
Lloyd 's be be squeeze out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product line such as primary property and marine insurance
at the peak of its power and influence a century ago , Lloyd 's dominate the insurance world with a 50 % stake
today , Lloyd 's share of the world market , exclude life insurance , be about 2 %
today , Lloyd 's share of the world market , exclude life insurance , be about 2 % . -lrb- its stake be even smaller if life insurance be include
bigger rival , such as Aetna and Allianz , back by army of statistician use computer in hundred of branch , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rate
beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline company be siphon off big chunk of the market by insure themselves through `` captive '' offshore company for industry-specific coverage
thus Lloyd 's can not react quickly to competition
Lloyd 's have lose control of the situation
the exchange face big challenge
by that , he mean low-margin but low-risk product such as certain type of primary property insurance
that will not be a easy task
tradition be dictator at Lloyd 's
three year ago , the exchange take up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain 's Prince Charles have denounce
the Lloyd 's market actively underwrite insurance just 4 1/2 hour a day
underwriting do not get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m
a two-hour lunch break follow
broker clutch thick folder stand in line , wait they turn to speak to the underwriter
underwriter also have be inept
he and he fellow underwriter underestimate by as much as 50 % the premium they should have charge for property risk from 1980 to 1985
more recently , property rate have increase
because of Lloyd 's practice of leave the book open for three year to allow for the settlement of claim
report profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he decline to specify how steep the decline will be
the departure of name be not likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion
meanwhile , the exchange have be try to lower cost
but Lloyd 's be hamper in its effort to overhaul operation by its reluctance to embrace modern technology
Mr. Wetherell , the underwriter , reckon half of he business could be transact by computer , cut cost at least 10 %
though Lloyd 's have talk for year about computerize underwriting transaction , the effort have not get very far
competition among underwriter and broker make they loath to centralize price and policy information
Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hamper effort to update marketing strategy
some underwriter have be press for year to tap the low-margin business by sell some policy directly to consumer
but such change must be clear by four internal committee and dozen of underwriter , broker and administrator before be implement
Lloyd 's be move forward on some front , though
the exchange be update some procedure to make speedier payment on claim
Mr. Dozen succeed Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman
in japanese firm , the president usually be in charge of day-to-day operation , while the chairman 's role be more a ceremonial one

in he climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also head the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income unit and its international operation
he be constantly pick up new thing to fill out he experience
but it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enable he to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sale force -- to accede to the presidency
if Mr. Dozen have a weakness , it may be he golf game

the buy-out effort also worsen already-strained relation between United 's pilot and machinist union
the machinist previously have show themselves to be a ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lose much of he credibility with that group when he team up with the pilot union
the machinist criticize the term Mr. Wolf and management receive in the buy-out
he credibility be also on the line in the investment community
they be disappoint the company do not announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value
that arbitrager could force a recapitalization through the write consent process under which holder may oust the board by a majority vote
Tandy 's decision be a second setback for U.S. Memories
that it would not invest in the group
its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chip , a market dominate by the japanese
its experience during the shortage do not merit the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment U.S. Memories be seek from each investor

if the CIA have become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the american people ought to know
what go wrong in Panama be a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry
the President of the United States urge the panamanian armed force to move against Mr. Noriega
for example , what exactly do the CIA tell major Giroldi and he fellow coup plotter about U.S. law and executive order on assassination
what part do U.S. warning play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he have General Noriega in custody , but be under attack by pro-noriega troops
Mr. Noriega do not suffer from any hesitation once he have the pistol
CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , get the debate start last week by note that the executive order ban assassination have contribute to U.S. paralysis during the coup
but instead simply underline Mr. Webster 's point
in other word , Congress will not let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that be fine with the CIA
and of course , do anything that might be second-guess by Congress carry heavy penalty
witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North
no doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it
what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who have read all this and know what can happen if they fail
the order against assassination be another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescind the order as a ambiguous intrusion on he ability to defend America 's national security
but rescind the executive order be not the same thing as say the U.S. should start pass out explode cigar
the world be the nasty place it be , we want president to have the freedom to order operation in which someone might get kill
the executive order and the report agreement with the Intelligence Committee be neither sensible nor moral

dealer say the bud trade in Mr. Jackson 's cancel check be unusual
but these player be dead
however , the thought of a living player sell he check rub some people the wrong way

once you make up you mind about a investment , the rest be easy , right
dream on
so here be a rundown of the most common type of market order permit by the stock and commodity exchange
two thing to keep in mind
with a market order , a investor tell a broker to buy or sell `` at the market
for example , if wheat be be offer at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be fill at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
investor do this by specify a minimum price at which the investment may be sell or the maximum price that may be pay for it
suppose a investor want to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55
a limit order to sell could be enter at that price
stop order tell a floor broker to buy or sell a investment once the price reach a certain level
once the price reach that level , a stop order turn into a market order , and the order be fill at whatever price the broker can get
while stop order sound similar to limit order , there be a difference
the crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully teach some investor exactly what stop order will and will not do
stop-limit order turn into limit order when a investment trade at the price specify in the order
unlike stop order stop-limit order demand that the trade be make only at the specify price
however , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order be enter at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order be enter at a price above it
the fill-or-kill order be one of several associate with the timing of trade
he use fill-or-kill order almost exclusively when trade option
I like to use they to feel out the market
this be another timing order
this be really two order in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instruct floor broker to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order
this type of order couple many of the order describe above with instruction that the order must be carry out at or by a certain time
stop-close-only order '' be stop order that only become active during the closing minute of trading
on Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investor learn the consequence of enter `` good-til-canceled limit order '' and then forget about they
it be always the responsibility of investor to keep track of the order they have place
beta be a handy gauge that measure the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund
cautious investor should generally go with stock that have low beta
remember , though , that beta also have important limitation
beta be only part of the risk in a stock
in particular , beta do not measure the company - and industry-specific risk associate with a individual stock
we fear be people would look just at the beta -lcb- of a gold fund -rcb- and say here be a investment with very low risk
this be clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like baby every night , lull by vision of you money sit risk-free in six-month cd
they estimate the return a person 's current portfolio be likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggest how much the return will vary year by year
when it come to invest , try to weigh risk and reward can seem like throw dart blindfold
a letter from Senator John Kerry chide we today for imply that he have `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega
we October 12 editorial should have be more precise
the sandinista of Nicaragua , for example , also be part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus
he have not make that intellectual leap
throughout the 1980 , investor have be look for creative alternative to traditional mode of financial planning
my revolutionary system be also useful for those who have try customary form of grow they currency cushion
so throughout the decade I have maintain my share of individual retirement account and cd , and tinker with stock , bond and mutual fund , as well as preserve my necessary position in the residential real-estate market
Figure 1 demonstrate the performance of those business I have invest in during this prosperous decade
likewise , mutual fund remain relatively flat until I make what be , for I , a serious investment
by 1987 , these property be in a tailspin , cause my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she would `` never see anything like it
concerned for she state of mind , I drop they -- and the market instantly begin its steady climb back to health
we have all get money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep dispose of it
but here in figure 2 be where I have choose to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuit ; child 's toy ; garden equipment , bulb and shrub ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all
continue investment in my 1984 subcompact have be part of my strategy -lrb- figure 5 -rrb- , with present annual contribution now equal more than 60 % of the car 's original value

with this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to year of fine life-style investment and increase widespread leverage
so go out there and eat that debt
when JAMES SCHWARTZ be just a lad he father give he a piece of career advice
he tell I to choose a area where just by be mediocre I could be great

but in this case the needle have a very sharp point
but in effect they operate in the dark
there be no effective regulation of planner , no accept standard for admission into they rank no way to assess they performance , no way even to know how many of they there be
so it should come as no shock that the profession , if that be what it be , have attract a lot of people whose principal talent seem to be fritter away or flat-out steal they client ' money
alarm , state and federal authority be try to devise way to certify and regulate planner
industry group and reputable planner who be member of they want comprehensive standard , too
but reform have not take hold yet
a admittedly limited survey by NASAA find that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planner cost 22,000 investor $ 400 million
so do just about all the loss that could be attribute to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planner
the danger to investor from incompetence be `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery
the best planner might be no planner at all
but as a consumer advocate she feel impel to take it
the bad news , however , have not be bad enough to kill the grow demand for financial planning
and the pool of capital they influence be enormous
the sheer number of planner make the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate
even the minority of they who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment adviser have be enough to swamp the agency 's capacity
the SEC have only about 200 staffer assign to keep tab on investment adviser -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of adviser have triple to about 15,000 over the past decade
currently , a registered investment adviser can expect a SEC audit only once every 12 year
a lot of bad thing can happen in 12 year
so the SEC have propose to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turn over to a industry-funded , self-regulatory organization pattern on the National Association of Securities Dealers
the proposal have set off a lively debate within a industry that be far from unite to begin with
Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , say that allow the business to police itself would be `` like put Dracula in charge of the blood bank
mr.gargan 's view be not greet with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization
the state have they own idea about regulation and certification
NASAA , the organization of state security regulator , be push for a model regulatory statute already adopt in eight state
the most common conflict involve compensation
that nearly 90 % of planner receive some or all of they income from sale commission on security , insurance and other financial product they recommend
in 1986 the New York attorney general 's office get a order from a state court in Albany shut down First Meridian Corp. , a Albany financial-planning firm that have invest $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investor
the company consistently shove unwary customer into high-risk investment in painting , coin and Florida condo
investor be further assure that only those with a minimun net worth would be accept
and First Meridian 's president , Roger V. Sala , portray himself as a `` financial expert '' when he qualification largely consist of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth
that the attorney general 's contention about First Meridian 's business practice be incorrect
civil suit against planner by client seek recovery of fund be increasingly common
two such action could be particularly embarrassing to the industry
Mr. Peterson promise the bank purchase would be complete by the end of 1988 or the money return
wear a business suit and western-style hat and boot , he open up he briefcase and dump $ 1 million in cash on a table in front of the director
and the sale never come off
accord to the suit , Mr. Peterson have yet to return the plaintiff ' investment
they want it back
he be consider a defamation suit against the plaintiff
reard the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson say it be fill with `` inflammatory language and half truth
the suit against he be less a measure of he work than they be a `` sign of the time '' in which people generally be more prone to sue
he do not consider himself a financial planner anymore
in many scam or allege scam involve planner , it be plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investor would have keep they out of harm 's way
certificate of deposit do not pay 23 % a year , for example , but that do not give pause to client of one Alabama planner

moreover , ostentation be appreciate

the rich image of Newport Beach also help lend the con artist ' operation a air of respectability
one reason they use Newport Beach be that it sound swankier than most address
nobody really know how much money bogus telemarketing operator really harvest
Newport Beach telemarketer concentrate on precious metal and oil-leasing deal that typically cost thousand of dollar a shot
in one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investor in Capital Trust Inc. be allegedly tell that they investment in precious metal be insure against loss `` cause by employee due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' accord to a indictment hand up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month
he client deny that there be any attempt to defraud investor
there be some business deal that go bad , '' Mr. Jones say , `` but no intent to defraud
Newport Beach operation differ from the Hollywood boiler room in style as well as in dollar

at time , salesman may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this be some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person be be include in

for some investor , it be the appearance that leave they deceive

a salesman `` use a business-venture approach '' with he , send investment literature , a contract limit the firm 's liability , and a insurance policy

two seat on the Big Board be sell yesterday for $ 455,000 , and then $ 500,000
the previous sale be $ 436,000 on Oct. 17
the last time price be that low be November 1985 , when a seat sell for $ 425,000
but at least it be exercise
at least it have a little dash
like try to buy life insurance , for instance , a endeavor notably lack in dash
over the past decade or two the insurance industry have spawn a incredible number of product , variation on product , and variation on the variation
besides term life and whole life -lrb- the old standby -rrb- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policy with persistency bonus , policy festoon with exotic rider , live benefit policy , and on and on
first , generalize
if all you want be death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- give you maximum bang for you buck , within limit
but `` term '' mean just that
it may also stipulate that the insure must pass another medical exam before renewal
if you flunk you may not be able to buy it
Amex say it would charge I $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay I back all the premium I put in if I cancel the policy after 10 year
second , the $ 5,760 I would get back would be much diminish in purchase power by 10 year of inflation
Third and most important , Amex would charge I a far higher premium than other reputable company would on a straight term policy for the same amount
I would be pay so heavily just to have the option of get my premium back that I would almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
which go to show that the First Law apply in insurance as in anything else
this be worth remember when insurer and they salesman try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amass cash value
but salesman dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemism , prefer to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead
that be gilding the lily
that be because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort require to sell and service the whole package
and in most case , a huge hunk of you premium in the initial year or two of the the policy be , in effect , pay the salesman 's commission as well
the simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance be the straight whole life policy
one newer wrinkle have be immensely popular in recent year for tax reason
I be not prepare in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category call universal life
hugely popular , it be far more flexible than straight whole life
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount go into investment
also , some policy illustration assume that mortality cost will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year
at a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boast that she 'll only have to pay premium on she John Hancock policy for seven year and that she death benefit will then be `` guarantee
yes , he say , premium on such variable-rate coverage can be structure to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rate stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection
so-called living-benefits provision also merit a close inspection
these policy rider let I tap a portion of my death benefit while I be still alive
some provision would let I collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stay
insurere sell these policy market they directly to the public or otherwise do not use commission salesman
I compare one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such a insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operate through 11,000 commission salesman
the difference be magnify by time , too

whose sale and market share in the U.S. have slip in the first half of 1989
he say Rorer opt to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increase marketing effort behind Maalox
Rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period

when he Seventh Avenue fur business here be fly high 20 year ago , Jack Purnick have 25 worker and a large factory
the difference lie in how the two entrepreneurial furrier react to the foreign competition and transformation of they industry over the past 10 year
the small , good fur salon be not what it use to be
import have reinvigorate the industry in which he have work for most of he 57 year
import competition for U.S. fur have rise sharply since furrier start aggressively market `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced import fur in recent year
merchant discover a consumer largely ignore by higher-priced furrier : the younger woman -- even in she late 20 -- who never think she could buy a mink
it also open the door to fur make in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other country
it operate 35 retail outlet in the U.S. and plan to open 15 more by the end of next year
many of the the import unstylish and poorly make
but low-priced and middle-priced furrier like Mr. Purnick say import have cut they sale
yet Mr. Rosen have turn the import phenomenon to he advantage
early in the decade he see that fur worker in many foreign country be willing to work longer hour at lower wages than they american counterpart and be more open to innovation

Heidi Ehman might have step from a recruiting poster for young republican
White , 24 year old , a singer in she church choir , she symbolize a generation that give its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan
no longer
when the Supreme Court open the door this year to new restriction on abortion , Ms. Ehman open she mind to democratic politics
this be one where I cross party line
people my age think it be not go to be a issue
the new politics of abortion have contribute to a world turn upside down for Mr. Courter
unless he close the gap , Republicans risk lose not only the governorship but also the assembly next month
this change come less from a shift in public opinion than in the boundary of the debate
before July , pro-choice voter could safely make political decision without focus narrowly on abortion
now , the threat of further restriction add a new dimension , bring a upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights force
if Webster have not happen , you would not be here
New Jersey be a prove ground for this aggressive woman 's - rights movement this year
the infusion of activist can bring a clash of culture
in Cherry Hill , the National Abortion Rights Action League target a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause
I wish I could go work out , '' say a slim activist
no age group be more sensitive than younger voter , like Ms. Ehman
a year ago this fall , New Jersey voter under 30 favor George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis , accord to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute
a match Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month show a complete reversal
abortion alone can not explain this shift , but New Jersey be a model of how so personal a issue can become a baseline of sort in judge a candidate
look back , he say he err by state he `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assure voter that he would not impose he view on `` policy '' as governor
he do not know himself
even abortion opponent , however angry with Mr. Florio , can not hide they frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence
but the abortion issue be only a reminder of the gap between he record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean
but this history make it harder for the conservative to run against government
Fluent in Spanish from he day in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively court minority voter but seem oddly over he head
yet minute after promise to appoint Hispanics to high post in state government , he be unable to say whether he have ever employ any in he congressional office
I do not think we do now
ask the same question after he appearance , Democrat Florio identify a staff member by name and explain she whereabouts today
in the opinion of many , he have not stop run since
he base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee help he sustain a network of political-action committee to preserve he edge
more than ever , he pro-consumer and pro-environment record be in sync with the state
auto insurance rate be soar
a toxic-waste-dump fire destroy part of a interstate highway this summer
but at age 52 , the congressman be also a product of he time and loss
he speak for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21
he speak for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase state revenue he focus not on `` tax '' but on `` audit '' to cut waste
and Mr. Florio retool himself as the lean , mean democratic fighting machine of the 1990
and instead quote the Grateful Dead
but he tie to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption
Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divide some of he old constituency
Pasquale Pignatelli , a unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in a Essex County Irish bagpipe band , speak sadly of Mr. Florio
I be a devout Catholic
if you want more opinion ask my wife
but many economist be not nearly as jubilant
I think inflation be go to pick up through the fall
but retail energy price decline 0.9 % in September
still , some analyst insist that the worst of the inflation be behind
in both 1987 and 1988 , consumer price rise 4.4 %
Mr. Yardeni predict that world business competition will continue to restrain price
the bottom line be , it seem to I that the economic environment have become very , very competitve for a lot of business
back in 1987-88 , business be operate at fairly tight capacity , so business feel they could raise price
the mild inflation figure renew investor ' hope that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance
in the past several day , however , the U.S. 's central bank have allow a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the market
exclude the volatile category of energy and food consumer price still rise only 0.2 % in September
transportation cost actually fall 0.5 % , and housing cost gain only 0.1 %
apparel price rocket up 1.7 % , but that be after three month of decline
car price still show decline at the consumer level

we want to show it be okay if you fall
many resort also be focus more on the service side of they business
and add entertainment for kid
kid can ski through and pan for fool 's gold
a few year ago , parent usually have to hire a sitter or take turn skiing while one spouse stay with the child
to make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitor , several resort be buy or start they own travel agency
because skiing be still expensive
and most vacationer still prefer a warm climate for they winter excursion
even if they could bring in that many new skier , I do not know if -lcb- the industry -rcb- could handle that kind of a increase

I would sleep through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summer ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I be unprepared for one reaction to such thing : the urge to talk about they

I be near the top of the stadium , and see a steel girder bow six foot from where I sit , but I stay put for 10 or 15 minute
here in the global Village , though , folk do not stay uninformed for long
but battery-operated radio and television set be plentiful

that there also have be damage of the sort report by my friend
tv reporter interview fan in the parking lot while , a few foot away , other watch the interview on they portable tv
the only frenzy I see be commercial
the traffic jam out of the park be monumental
it take I a half-hour to move 10 foot from my parking spot in a outer lot to a aisle , and a additional hour to reach a inner roadway a half-block away
at my hotel , the Westin , power be out , some interior plaster have break loose and there have be water damage , but little else
with garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the Amfac , have be hit harder
that the earthquake make the World Series seem unimportant

the `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bear a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth
and liquidity be what market need to damp quake and aftershock
in today 's market , specialist -lrb- on the New York Stock Exchange -rrb- and `` upstairs '' market maker -lrb- in the over-the-counter market -rrb- be the only market participant allow to play a direct role in the price-determination process
when that happen , `` seismic '' tremor of fear course through the market and increase the market 's volatility
when market tremor start , it be crucial that as much information about transaction price and the supply-demand curve be make available to all , not just to market maker
because of a lack of information and access , many investor -- include the very one whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- be force to stand on the sideline when they be most need , because of they ignorance of important market information
contrary to some opinion , the trading activity of specialist and other market maker do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole
what market maker provide be immediacy , a very valuable service
liquidity be not a service
as a result the market as a whole remain in the same circumstance it be before the transaction
the unwanted position be still a unwanted position
in a open electronic system , any investor wish to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a register broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve -lrb- buy and sell order at each price -rrb- enter by dealer and investor alike , and to enter and execute order

the economy 's stutter step leave investor wonder whether thing be slow down or speed up
for the past seven year , investor have have the wind at they back , in the form of a generally grow economy
some may have forget what it be like to invest during a recession
in a nutshell , pro advise investor who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stock than usual and to favor share of big company in `` defensive '' industry
because recession often take investor by surprise
they always seem to come a bit later than you expect
interest rate almost always decline during recession
as surely as a seesaw tilt , fall interest rate force up the price of previously issue bond
but short-term bond can not rise too much
but not just any bond will do

the two have a prior commitment
he figure wrong
last week Warner file a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters
Sony promptly countersue , charge Warner with try to sabotage its acquisition and hurt its effort to enter the U.S. movie business
and they be a very odd team in any case
Mr. Guber be raise in Boston and educate in New York
he be a lawyer with a string of academic degree
rival such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have be thrash Columbia at the box office
they stock in trade as `` executive producer '' be sniff out hot property , lock they up and then get big studio to bankroll and distribute they
sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` the Color Purple
with MGM/UA 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , messrs.guber and Peters have virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but they name still appear in big letter on the credit , and they be inevitably associate with its success
and when you be make a movie this big , you need all the help you can get
and some movie seem to have be hurt by they inattention
Warner executive blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problem and the film 's ultimate dismal failure
but by and large this company have only be profitable
he company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` be why we 'll be good at Columbia
Peter be a major piece of Hollywood manpower who have really earn he success , '' say Robert Bookman , a agent at Creative Artists Agency
he have a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority
and he detractor like to characterize he as something of a hot-tempered bully
he also have to fight harder for credibility than he partner do
Barbra Streisand make he famous
he cut she hair
he live with she
they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team
Peter be the bright , sympathetic guy when you be do a deal
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherd `` Flashdance '' through several script and ultimately produce the movie , bristle when Messrs.Guber and Peters take credit for the film
the script be unreadable
we reinvent it
we be the producer of that movie
they make he forfeit all credit and financial interest in the film he have help develop , include `` Rainman '' and `` Batman
Mr. Peters acknowledge that and say it be not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber be in with Warner
he relationship with Guber Peters be `` one of the most successful I have have in Hollywood
the two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon be very impulsive , and Peter be very compulsive
Jon Peters will come barrel into a room , say he be get a great idea , and be go
that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shift into high gear a few year back upon learn that they have competition for the story of the murder naturalist Dian Fossey
within a few week , we make deal with the government of Rwanda and everyone who have ever meet or talk to Dian Fossey
the sale cause a rift between the widow and some of she husband 's follower
but it be puzzling to some Hollywood executive that Sony rush to hire they without clear up the Warner situation first
its about whether the ink be red or black
Mr. Guber get he start in the movie business at Columbia two decade ago
recruit from New York University 's MBA program , he rise within two year to head of production , oversee such film as `` the way we be , '' `` taxi driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo
in 1980 , Mr. Guber get together with Mr. Peters
while Guber Peters produce a number of hit for Warner and other , they record be not always so impressive
and the failure make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producer as ingrate
that executive at Warner have always know of they ambition to run a major entertainment powerhouse
from the beginning , -lcb- they -rcb- know we have a goal and a dream
on a number of occasion he try to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright
in 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contribute they company 's asset in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry tv production company control by Giant Industries Inc. . Chairman Burt Sugarman
when Messrs.Guber , Peters and Sugarman make a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM/UA
but the MGM plan collapse just two week later
they relationship with Mr. Sugarman sour shortly thereafter
and earnings have be erratic
in the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earn $ 5.8 million , or 50 cent a share , compare to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cent a share , in last year 's quarter
the two side now be accuse each other of lie
but in affidavit file yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros.Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such a oral agreement be ever make
and the lineup of Guber Peters picture for Warner be not as strong as it be now
that it be in its own interest to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia
during settlement talk , for example , Warner demand such thing as cable tv rights to Columbia movie and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly own with Warner , accord to executive involve in the talk
there be plenty of precedent in Hollywood for let people out of contract
the last time Columbia Pictures be look for a studio chief , they note , Warner release producer David Puttnam from he contract , then take he back after he be subsequently fire by he boss at Columbia
in he affidavit file yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicate he be not buy any such argument
first , there be the name : `` asset-backed security
and there be more
the asset back the security come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institution
the asset back the security come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.most earn high rating from credit agency
well , think twice
the slightly higher return be not enough to compensate for the extra risk
a lot of this stuff really be in untested water
such concern , however , have not stop asset-backed security from become one of Wall Street 's hottest new product
they have sell issue back by car loan , boat loan and recreational-vehicle loan
they have offer bundle of homeequity loan , as well as package of loan use to buy vacation time-share
last year , there be a issue of `` death-backed bond '' -- security back by loan to life-insurance policyholder
this be the heyday of debt
and lately broker have be push smaller investor into the asset-backed market
the entry fee be affordable
the trust then issue security that be underwrite by Wall Street brokerage firm and offer to investor
the booming market have open up a valuable new source of fund to issuer , while provide a valuable new investment for individual and institution
consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % security issue last spring and back by Citibank credit-card receivable
the triple-a-rated issue offer a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issue
but Mr. Powers have purchase asset-backed issue for individual with tax-deferred account , such as retirement plan
another concern be liquidity
that be particularly true for certain of the security , such as those back by time-share loan
in addition , a investor who want to know the daily value of Treasury bond , or corporate bond trade on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listing
investor , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally hold the asset be guarantee the security
that mean investor have to focus on the quality of the debt that lie beneath the security , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit rating the issue have receive
take the `` credit enhancement , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company
but skeptic ask why you should bother buy this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yield on government-guaranteed paper
some money manager still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlie asset
at the very least , a recession would prompt investor to buy the highest-quality bond they can find -- that be , Treasurys
but it could be much worse
some analyst be especially wary of credit-card issue
nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys
those portfolio be remarkably diversify
for example , 12 % of this year 's respondent say they expect a recession within 12 month
a additional 56 % of this year 's respondent expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 month
apparently , the respondent do not think that a economic slowdown would harm the major investment market very much
they verdict on real estate be almost the same
by contrast , only 32 % expect a increase in the price of gold
many respondent be take a better-safe-than sorry investment stance
nearly a third say they have make some portfolio change to anticipate a possible recession
a buy-and-hold approach to stock continue to be the rule among respondent
most own two to 10 stock , and buy or sell no more than three time a year
some 71 % have buy some stock in the past year
but the lurk shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seem dark
and the respondent ' commitment to the stock market remain somewhat lighter than usual
it lower its rating on about $ 75 million of this Chatsworth , Calif. , concern 's convertible subordinated debenture , due 2012 , to Caa from b2
it lower its rating on about $ 400 million of this bank hold company 's senior debt to b2 from ba3

that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' have be on the rise over the past half century
in only one presidential election year prior to 1948 do more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional district choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives
as we know , voter tend to favor Republicans more in race for president than in those for Congress
in every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP have capture a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it have of congressional seat or the popular vote for Congress
if these assumption hold , voter in race for Congress face what in economic theory be call a prisoner 's dilemma and have a incentive , at the margin , to lean democratic
but they select legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislator from `` bring home the bacon '' to they respective constituency
in race for the White House , a voter 's incentive , at the margin , be to lean Republican
such a president be also likely to be more effective at prevent other districts/states and they legislator from bring home the local benefit
second , it explain why voter hold Congress in disdain but generally love they own congressional representative
fourth , the theory indicate why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attract viable candidate for congressional office
potential candidate may be discourage from run less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hand of a democratic opponent
Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting have be particularly pronounce in the South
finally , the theory suggest why republican generally have fare better in Senate race than in campaign for the House
that GOP senator turn back roughly 10 % more of they allocate personal staff budget than democrat do
this be indeed what the datum indicate , particularly in the case of the House
moreover , ticket splitting appear to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it do at the federal level

under the proposal , a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of `` rescission '' to the Hill -- once when he propose he budget and again after Congress dispose
the proposal would restore some discipline erase from the budget process by the 1974 Budget `` Reform '' Act
before 1974 , a President could `` impound , '' or refuse to spend , fund appropriate by Congress
today a President can still send up spending rescission , but they be meaningless unless Congress have a guilty conscience and change its mind
and naturally rescission be almost never approve
in 1987 , President Reagan send 73 rescission back to the Hill , but only 3 % of the spending total be approve by Congress
Senator Coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cut take place automatically unless Congress act
President Bush have endorse the idea , and at least 50 sit senator have vote to support enhance rescission authority in the past

this be not a new kind of union leadership , it be a new Mexico
Pemex desperately need new investment
since world oil price collapse in 1982 , the government have siphon Pemex 's coffer to make payment on Mexico 's $ 97 billion foreign debt
little money have be return to upgrade Pemex 's aging facility
the union have drain it from below
the decline in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico have be import gasoline this year
union perk have simply get out of hand
the union also cede the 2 % commission it have receive on all Pemex maintenance contract
the new contract also eliminate the $ 15 monthly coupon
also , because of its reduce capital budget , Pemex have phase out about 50,000 transitory construction worker , reduce the work force to about 140,000
but Pemex manager be the one most thrill by the contract
it would never give notice to its customer
the capriciousness would completely disrupt we operation
tame the union complement previous move by the government to attract private investment in petrochemical
but Pemex 's courtship with private company , and especially foreign one , be controversial in a country where oil have be a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holding be nationalize in 1938

that British Air will take a more active , high-profile role in pursue any new bid
British Air have not receive any new buy-out proposal from the labor-management group , lead by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf , and have not receive any indication of when one might be forthcoming
a revise transaction with less debt leverage be likely to be more attractive to bank
but decline to specify a figure

this lead to proposal for `` reform '' of the Fed
they rest on a incorrect view
they would not solve the problem
the price level in the U.S. be now about 4 1/4 time as high as it be 30 year ago
the enormous inflation over the past 30 year be largely due to monetary policy
even where the Fed do not share this view it feel the need to accommodate to it
put the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors , one of the lead proposal today , be a example
the secretary be the world 's biggest borrower of money
true , a succession of Fed chairman have give color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belong on the Fed
by they constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matter the chairman have encourage the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy be ingredient of a common stew
the Fed 's problem be not that it be too independent , or too unpolitical
the Fed be responsive to , and can not help be responsive to , the more overtly political part of the government
critic of the present arrangement be correct to say that it be undemocratic
what be undemocratic be the unwillingness of the more political part of the government to take the responsibility for decide the basic question of monetary policy , which be what priority should be give to stabilize the price level
the greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilize the price level be the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System
it be not the kind of thing that be likely to be enact , however
but that be not the same as say that the Federal Reserve have other objective

I think the restructuring will get the required support
but B.A.T 's restructuring now will take longer because of the market upheaval
the market gyration could delay the action well into the second half
we be not force seller
