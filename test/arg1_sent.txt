or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran jewish comedian appear in a new ABC sitcom air on Tuesday night -lrb- 9:30 -10 p.m. EDT -rrb-
here , in neutral language , be the gist of Mr. Mason 's remark , quote first in the Village Voice
Mr. Mason say that many jewish voter feel guilty toward black , so they support black candidate uncritically
he say that many black voter feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidate uncritically
of course , Mr. Mason do not use neutral language
Mr. Mason instinctively reach for the vernacular

do not say the tv sitcom , because that happen to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resemble politics more than it do comedy
it be worth note that both disapprove relative be immigrant
at least , they both speak with strong accent , as do Jackie and Maddie
clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' be not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all
so far , the bubble have be few and far between
part of the problem be the tendency of all sitcom to preach about social issue
for instance , Michael dislike Jackie not because he be a shrewd jewish businessman , but because he quit he well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more problematic be the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona
I be not suggest that the producer start put together episode about topic like the catholic-jewish dispute over the carmelite convent at Auschwitz
but I be suggest that they stop require Mr. Mason to interrupt he classic shtik with some line about `` care for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lip of Miss America
the underlie economy remain sound
there be nothing wrong with the economy
late Friday night , the Senate vote 87-7 to approve a estimate $ 13.5 billion measure that have be strip of hundred of provision that would have widen , rather than narrow , the federal budget deficit

I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion
the explosion of junk bond and takeover have lodge a lot of insecure security in the hand of investor and load the corporation that be the object of takeover or fear takeover with huge amount of debt rather than equity

Renaissance be keep its money entirely in cash equivalent , primarily U.S. Treasury bill
yes , he do
he do repeat those nice platitude several time as a indication of he support for the Constitution
unfortunately , by my rough guess , he use better than 5,000 word heap scorn on the witness for exercise the Fifth
he sandwich he praise of constitutional meat between large loaf of bilious commentary
as you editorial rightly point out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` be currently be hold up to scorn for take the Fifth Amendment
that he `` committee do not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD
apparently , they verdict be in
apparently , they verdict be in.Right now they be pursue evidence
of course , Mr. Lantos doth protest that he subcommittee simply seek information for legislative change
no doubt that be partially true
everything that Mr. Lantos say in he letter be partially true
but if he explanation of motivation be true , why be he investigation so orient as to identify criminal activity?why not simply question design to identify source and cause of waste and inefficiency?such as , what happen when Congress want to know about $ 400 toilet seat or whatever they supposedly cost
no , to my mind , the Journal do not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust
the system be the problem , not a individual member
individual can always have they hand slap
but I think the kind of congressional investigation that have be pursue be a far greater danger to american notion of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -lrb- and , yes , maybe criminality -rrb- within HUD could possibly generate
the Fifth Amendment state in relevant part that no person `` shall be compel , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself
thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be call as a witness , he may be force to testify or take the Fifth , and he taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of a adverse inference against he in the civil matter
he may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he have a good faith and justifiable belief that he testimony may subject he to criminal prosecution
allow the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter be not base on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harm he in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally use against he in a subsequent criminal prosecution
one must conclude that he hold a good-faith , justifiable belief that he testimony could be use against he in a subsequent criminal prosecution
thus , when Mr. Pierce assert the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receive extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he hold a good-faith , justifiable belief that he testimony could be use against he in a subsequent criminal prosecution.the subcommittee , Congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that he testimony could help convict he of a crime

Mr. Awad , however , worry that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 point in the next few day
it can happen before you can turn around
he discern many parallel with 1987 , include the emphasis on takeover stock and the re-emergence of computerized program trading
not really insurance , this tactic be design to soften the blow of decline stock price and generate a offsetting profit by sell wave of S&P future contract

in many way , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline be eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash
then , as now , the budget debate be behind schedule and automatic spending cut be within day of take hold
but a similar outcome do not seem likely this year
the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble
everybody think we be look at a repetition of 1929 , that we be look at a recession
