what we be do be screen out the reader who be only casually related to the magazine and do not really read it , '' say Mr. Heinemann
we be try to create quality and involvement
it be terrific for advertiser to know the reader will be pay more , '' say Michael Drexler , national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency
a few drop in circulation be of no consequence
it be not a show of weakness
they be improve the quality of circulation while insure they profit
the question be how much be we get from each reader
they say , ` follow CNN
it be bigger , faster and more profitable than the news division of any of the three major broadcast network
its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crisis draw elite audience around the world
although viewership soar when big news break , it ebb during period of calm
CNN executive worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be get stale
you can not live on that
Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in year , a hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscast
to distinguish itself , CNN be also expand international coverage and add a second global-news program
it be pay higher salary -- after year of scrimp -- to lure and keep experienced staffer
Networks , like other consumer product , develop image in people ' mind that be not easy to change
already , CNN be face stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel
its watcher be , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazer '' and news junkie , who spend a average of just 26 minute a day watch CNN , accord to audience research
that be less than one-third the time that viewer watch the major broadcast network
the brief attention viewer give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as rating datum , and advertising , become more important to cable-tv channel
it focus on build up its news bureau around the world , so as event take place it could go live quicker and longer than other network
it fill its daily schedule with newscast call `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the show vary little in content , personality or look
we goal be to create more program with a individual identity
I find it hard to conceive of people switch over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , be the same news , '' say Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report
in August , the network hire award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news special at ABC
the headline create by such scoop will generate excitement for its `` brand '' program , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' do so well for CBS
they have never show any inclination to spend money on production , '' say Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour
CNN recently give most employee raise of as much as 15 % , but they be still drastically underpaid compare with the network
they be on top of everything
they market cable-tv on the very grazing opportunity CNN seek to discourage
we would obviously be upset if those kind of service evolve into more general-interest , long-format programming

analyst immediately view the price datum , the grimmest inflation news in month , as evidence that the Federal Reserve be unlikely to allow interest rate to fall

both can serve as mechanism for ease tension and facilitate the co-existence of group in conflict
that be why it be dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campus and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group difference
the question be , if group conflict still exist -lrb- as undeniably they do -rrb- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor be passe , then what other means do we have for let off steam
it be true that the best sitcom do allow group difference to simmer
at least , they both speak with strong accent , as do Jackie and Maddie
it could not be more obvious that `` Chicken Soup '' be be make from a old recipe
so far , the bubble have be few and far between
part of the problem be the tendency of all sitcom to preach about social issue
to some extent , this tendency emerge whenever the show try to enlighten we about ethnic stereotype by reverse they
even more problematic be the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona
the best moment in the show occur at the beginning and the end -lrb- and occasionally in the middle -rrb- , when Mr. Mason slip into he standup mode and start mete out that old-fashioned jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself

the last time I see a similar congressional hearing be when `` Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy do he work
this privilege against self-incrimination preclude the drawing of a adverse inference against a criminal defendant who choose not to testify
he may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he have a good faith and justifiable belief that he testimony may subject he to criminal prosecution
allow the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter be not base on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harm he in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally use against he in a subsequent criminal prosecution
absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify
the subcommittee , Congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that he testimony could help convict he of a crime
draw the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing do not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination
